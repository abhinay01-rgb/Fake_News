The Most Powerful Indians in 2024 That this seems an all-too familiar story only goes to show how overwhelmingly dominant theBJPremains, its shot at a third term in power marked by the same confidence \u2014 and thin skin \u2014 that was seen just ahead of the 2019 elections. The Opposition had seen a glimmer then, after some substantive Assembly wins. Much water has flown under the bridge since then, with the BJP having wrested the states it lost to the Congress in 2019 \u2014 ensuring that for the seventh year running,Narendra ModiandAmit Shahremain No. 1 and 2 in the power list, with the top 10 comprising all RSS/BJP names, barring Chief Justice of India D Y Chandrachud and business titan Gautam Adani, who climbs up from No. 33 in his bounce-back from the Hindenburg controversy. It\u2019s only in the next 10 ranks that the Opposition comes in, withMamata Banerjeeat No. 15, just ahead ofRahul GandhiandArvind Kejriwal. In the face of the BJP\u2019s dominance, the three are here for their perseverance \u2014 the Trinamool Congress chief for holding her ground; the Congress leader for forging his own Yatra as his party crumbles; and theAam Aadmi Partysupremo for weathering the face-off with the Centre. Karnataka CMSiddaramaiahand his Tamil Nadu counterpart MK Stalin rank in the high 20s for forging a front against the BJP, raising a Southern barrier the party is finding difficult to cross. In a business world dominated by the Adanis and Ambanis, Azim Premji continues to stand apart, with his path-setting philanthropy taking him to No. 37, from 69 in 2023. Neeraj Chopra, the Olympic gold medallist who continues to earn laurels on the field and off it \u2014the javelin star\u2019s family spoke up for his Pakistani rival \u2014 also makes an entry into the list. For how she defied powerful BJP leaderBrij Bhushan Sharan Singhin the Wrestling Federation of India, wrestler Vinesh Phogat plants her flag too. A star who continues to script one of the greatest comeback stories, Shah Rukh Khan blazes his way up to No. 27. Take a pause here. For, the next face from entertainment isAlia Bhatt, at 79, followed closely byDeepika Padukone. If women are finally having their moment in Bollywood, these two lead the way. For the biggest stars and the biggest fallen stars of this power list, look elsewhere. Halved-party leaders Sharad Pawar and Uddhav Thackeray are down 35-plus points to No. 94 and 95, respectively. While the one with the biggest boost, of 44 ranks, is Infosys founder Nandan Nilekani. Now headlining a government online initiative, Nilekani has done the near impossible \u2014 he has thrived across the UPA era to NDA. Fitting, given how hisAadhaarframework laid the foundation for the digital substack at the heart of this government\u2019s promise of economic empowerment. A pointer, perhaps, to what should be the imperative of power in a deeply contested democracy \u2014 its ability to cut across fault-lines to shape and secure the common good. 1) Narendra Modi, 73Prime Minister of India Why Because Prime Minister Narendra Modi has only grown taller and stronger \u2014 no PM has entered an election year, looking at another term, with so resounding a popularity. For his party, his \u201c370-seat\u201d call rides on the wave of two terms of his government that has ramped up welfare, kept growth ticking, moderatedinflationand secured a special place for India in the world. All this backed by a formidable party machinery, deliveries on ideological promises, including abrogation of Article 370 and consecration of the Ram Temple. Most criticism \u2014 centralisation of power, use of agencies, undermining of institutions, shrinking space for dissent, minority representation \u2014 bounces off as he frames it as the rage of the Congress ancien regime. Power Punch A double bill: the G20 summit where NewDelhisecured a consensus at the global high table; and conducting the pran pratishtha at Ayodhya, sending a message, loud and clear, that to him the State\u2019s engagement with religion was no breach of a line \u2014 he was only drawing a new one. What Next Modi carries the burden of the NDA\u2019s target of 400 seats in the upcoming general elections almost entirely on his shoulders. If he returns, what new chapters will he script in governance and politics towards his \u201cpromise\u201d of making India the third-largest economy in the world? How he steers the wheel on delimitation, Centre-state relations and social harmony will shape his legacy. SOCIAL MEDIA QUOTIENTX: @narendramodi 95.6M followers 2) Amit Shah, 59Union Home Minister Why He may not be the BJP party chief but Amit Shah is its chief strategist, helming the party juggernaut as it powers through the Hindi heartland \u2014 Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan andChhattisgarh\u2014 and targets new territories, including the southern states and West Bengal. His long political-personal arc with the Prime Minister and its steady climb upward set the tone and tenor for the rank and file right from the very top. Power Punch Shah piloted the three Bills that overhauled India\u2019s British-era criminal justice system. While doing so, he linked the new laws to the \u201ccountry\u2019s pride\u201d. Also, the BJP\u2019s target of 370 seats in the upcoming Lok Sabha polls is a reference to that other Bill that Shah piloted in 2019 \u2014 theJammuand Kashmir Reorganisation Act that resulted in the abrogation of Article 370, seen as the BJP\u2019s most decisive move yet. What Next Despite leading the political narrative on theCitizenship (Amendment) Act, there has been a pause on its implementation. The crucial census and the NPR enumeration hang in balance. In J&K, Shah\u2019s ministry and forces will have to check terrorist violence, now spreading to Jammu, and create conditions conducive for the political process to start. Manipur smoulders, remaining a stalled work in progress. SOCIAL MEDIA QUOTIENTX: @AmitShah 34.5M followers 3) Mohan Bhagwat, 73RSS Sarsanghchalak Why Bhagwat is sarsanghchalak of the RSS when the Sangh Parivar celebrates its longest uninterrupted innings in power. Article 370 and the Ram Temple, its key ideological milestones, have been reached. With PM Modi underlining in his January 22 speech that the temple marks a journey from \u201cRam to Rashtra\u201d and \u201cDev to Desh,\u201d the RSS knows that a third term for the BJP means its influence is only going to touch more and more aspects of governance. Power Punch The presence of Bhagwat beside Modi as the PM conducted the pran pratishtha at the Ram Temple sent out a powerful signal. For a while now, Bhagwat has been trying to articulate a moderate face of the RSS as is evident in his reaching out to minorities and his January 22 speech, when he spoke of the need to show \u201chosh\u201d (reason) amid the \u201cjosh\u201d (passion) \u2014 an articulation that comes from a position of strength where the RSS sees its ideological projects as having come to fruition. What Next With the Sangh looking at a third term as its chance to consolidate and effect disruptive change, Bhagwat\u2019s leadership of the RSS, which provides a significant number of foot soldiers for the BJP, will be crucial. The Sangh\u2019s longstanding demand for a nationwide Uniform Civil Code is likely to get louder with Uttarakhand implementing it in the state. SOCIAL MEDIA QUOTIENTNot on social media 4) DY Chandrachud, 64Chief Justice of India Why Blending erudition, sagacity and tact, Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud has led the Supreme Court in a fractious, polarised polity. In a crucial election year, with the Opposition fragmented, every observation, every verdict, is closely watched, including how he handles cases of judicial review, reshapes the collegium and the internal processes of judicial reform. Power Punch The CJI-led Bench settled, once and for all, legal doubts over the integration of J&K into the Indian Union, ruling in favour of the Centre\u2019s decision to abrogate Article 370. He gently but firmly put his foot down in favour of thebasic structure doctrine. Amid criticism that the Supreme Court was too often giving the Executive a free pass, came its unanimous decision striking downelectoral bonds. What Next His stint ends in November, six months into the new government\u2019s term. The SC still has some significant cases pending, including the challenge to the amendments to the Citizenship Act. SOCIAL MEDIA QUOTIENTNot on social media 5) S Jaishankar, 69Minister of External Affairs Why Almost five years into his job as Union External Affairs Minister, the thinker-diplomat-politician has emerged as the Modi government\u2019s most articulate voice on the global stage. His sharp retorts \u2014 \u201cIndia imports less oil from Russia in a month than Europe does in an afternoon\u201d, to asserting that India\u2019s purchase policies played a key role in stabilising the global oil and gas markets and he was \u201cwaiting for the thank you\u201d \u2014 shaped India\u2019s \u201cinternational power\u201d image. To his party\u2019s delight and advantage, he has brought high diplomacy to YouTube and Instagram. The Israel-Hamas war, however, tested India\u2019s diplomacy, with the government having to qualify its ringing endorsement of Israel by later adopting a more balanced position. Power Punch As the US accused an Indian official of plotting to kill Khalistan separatist GS Pannun, Jaishankar worked the phones and held in-person meetings with the Americans. This was in contrast to India\u2019s much sharper response to Canada\u2019s allegations. His understanding of big-power politics helped him tide over the crisis. What Next Will he contest the Lok Sabha elections? And in the event of a Modi 3.0, will he return as the country\u2019s foreign minister? SOCIAL MEDIA QUOTIENTX: @DrSJaishankar 3M followers 6)Yogi Adityanath, 51Chief Minister, Uttar Pradesh Why Because as Chief Minister of the state with the largest number of Lok Sabha constituencies, Yogi Adityanath is the man in the hottest of hot electoral seats. Will he deliver to his party the cleanest of sweeps in 2024 in the 80 seats from the state? As mahant of the Gorakhnath math, he combines his spiritual authority with his political might. Several CMs, including some in Opposition states, have borrowed from his controversial \u2018bulldozer justice\u2019 template. Power Punch Soon after the successful completion of the Ram Temple consecration ceremony came Ground-Breaking Ceremony 4.0, which saw the launch of over 14,000 projects worth over Rs 10 lakh crore \u2014 a promise ahead of the elections that under Adityanath, the government will deliver on faith and development. What Next The Lok Sabha polls, followed by the Assembly in 2027. As CM, he has been saying that he wants to make UP the largest economy of India, in absolute terms in the next three years. SOCIAL MEDIA QUOTIENTX: @myogiadityanath 27.7M followers 7)Rajnath Singh, 72Minister of Defence Why Rajnath Singh has wide administrative and political experience and has been the PM\u2019s seniormost colleague in the Cabinet. Having served both as a defence and home minister, he has a comprehensive view on national security. Known to be dependable and self-effacing, both in good times and in crisis, Singh enjoys goodwill among politicians across party lines. His unflagging energy is evident in the multiple trips he makes to countries as part of defence diplomacy and his participation in domestic events such as Aero India and DefExpo. He is also one of the seniors who is holding back channel talks to resolve issues with farmers. Power Punch As a trouble-shooter for the BJP and the government, Singh\u2019s intervention was sought to avoid any embarrassment for the party after it won the Rajasthan elections. Amid speculation thatVasundhara Rajecould put her foot down on the choice of chief minister, it was Singh who stepped in to implement the party\u2019s decision to have a new leadership in the state. What Next He is keen on building atma nirbharta in defence and increasing India\u2019s defence exports. SOCIAL MEDIA QUOTIENTX: @rajnathsingh 24 M followers 8)Nirmala Sitharaman, 64Minister of Finance and Corporate Affairs Why As India\u2019s first full-time and the longest serving woman finance minister, Sitharaman has been credited for presenting a fiscally prudentBudgetjust before elections. Under her leadership, the Indian economy has registered seven per cent-plus growth rate for three years in a row, inflation has been managed and the stage is set for capex spends and private investment. All this in the backdrop of global headwinds and a slowing down of the world economy. Power Punch With the latest presentation of theinterim Budgetfor 2024-25, Sitharaman has now presented six consecutive budgets as Finance Minister, equalling the record set by Morarji Desai and breaking the five-budget-in-a-row record of former finance ministersManmohan Singh,Yashwant Sinha, P Chidambaram andArun Jaitley. What Next Sitharaman will need to strike a fine balance maintaining the growth momentum amid the persistent risk from elevated inflation. SOCIAL MEDIA QUOTIENTX: @nsitharaman 5.4M followers 9) J P Nadda, 63BJP national president Why As the man leading the BJP organisation into the Lok Sabha elections, J P Nadda has his task cut out. In a party with Narendra Modi and Amit Shah, Nadda has held his own and gained the trust of the leadership and the rank and file, without coming across as someone trying to overproject himself. He has also switched gears \u2014 hard or soft \u2014 depending on the need of the hour. Power Punch In the recent Assembly elections to five states, seen as the semi-final to the Lok Sabha polls, the BJP under his leadership won convincingly in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, where exit polls had predicted a tight contest. The party also won Chhattisgarh, where it was seen as lagging behind the Congress during the campaign. In West Bengal, where the party is locked in a tough fight with the TMC for political space, Nadda has taken the gloves off. For instance, after the Sandeshkhali incident, he promptly constituted a high-powered BJP committee under Union minister Annapurna Devi to file a report on the allegations of rape made by women in Sandeshkhali. What Next Nadda, who has been renominated to theRajya Sabha, will focus all his energies on the BJP\u2019s campaign for the Lok Sabha polls as the party aims to return to power for the third time. SOCIAL MEDIA QUOTIENTX: @JPNadda 3.6M followers 10) Gautam Adani, 61Chairman, Adani Group Why Gautam Adani is the second richest person in India with a net worth of $101 billion. Under Adani, the group has made rapid progress in various infrastructure sectors such as cement, power, airport, green energy, ports, power and gas distribution through a string of acquisitions and greenfield projects. Opposition parties have accused him of being close to the ruling establishment at the Centre. Power Punch When Hindenburg Research came out with a report last year, alleging \u201cbrazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud\u201d in the group, his companies faced setbacks, shares crashed and a megaIPOwas pulled out. However, a year later, the group has bounced back, its share prices have recovered. What Next The Adani Group is planning to invest Rs 7 lakh crore in ports, power, green energy and airports. With entry into media, it plans to expand its footprints \u2014 and shape the \u201cnarrative\u201d around itself. SOCIAL MEDIA QUOTIENTX: @gautam_adani 1M followers 11) Mukesh Ambani, 66Chairman and Managing Director, RIL Why Mukesh Ambani is the richest Indian with a net worth of US $109 billion, according to Bloomberg Billionaires Index. He has strengthened the flagship Reliance Industries (RIL) through his focus on new energy, reorganisation and succession planning. Market capitalisation of RIL recently touched Rs 20 lakh crore, making it the most-valued listed company in the country. BharatGPT, backed by RIL, is now all set to launch an artificial intelligence model for India, named Hanooman. Power Punch Ambani demerged his financial services arm \u2014 Jio Financial Services (JFS) \u2014 and listed it on stock exchanges. JFS is now planning to enter the mutual fund segment. He brought his children to the board of RIL and has given them key positions in the group. While Akash handles the digital segment (Jio), daughter Isha heads the retail arm and Anant, the energy business. What Next Ambani is likely to spin off RIL\u2019s subsidiaries Jio Platform and the retail arm into separate entities and list them on the stock exchanges. He is also constructing the Dhirubhai Ambani Green Energy Giga Complex over 5,000 acres in Jamnagar, which will be the world\u2019s largest integrated renewable energy manufacturing facility. Social media quotientNot on social media 12)Piyush Goyal, 59Minister of Commerce and Industry, Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, Textiles, and Leader of the House, Rajya Sabha Why Piyush Goyal is among the top leaders of the BJP and is currently Leader of the House in the Rajya Sabha besides heading three ministries \u2014 Commerce and Industry, Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution and Textiles. Goyal was also seen as the firefighter for the government when he led the negotiations with the farmer leaders after they decided to hit the streets demanding a Minimum Support Prices (MSP) law. Power Punch After a lull of nearly a decade, India signed two free trade agreements (FTAs) with UAE and Australia and is in the progress of signing more deals that could boost Indian exports to newer geographies. What Next India could sign a trade deal with the UK, Oman and European Free Trade Association (EFTA) before the dates for the general elections are announced. Goyal needs to pursue a careful and calibrated approach while negotiating FTAs to ensure they are fair, equitable and balanced. India is also expected to take up the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) issue \u2018very strongly\u2019 with the European Union. Social media quotientX: @PiyushGoyal 12M followers 13)Ashwini Vaishnaw, 53Minister of Railways, Telecom and IT  Why In a short time, Ashwini Vaishnaw has established himself as one of the most important ministers in the Union Cabinet and achieved major infrastructure and regulatory milestones across all his three portfolios of Railways, Telecom and IT. He was recently renominated to the Rajya Sabha for a second term. Power Punch After a clean auction of 5G airwaves, India raced to deploy more than four lakh 5G towers in 15 months. This is among the fastest rollouts of such communication infrastructure. He held meetings with top tech companies in the US to persuade them to invest in India and is believed to have been instrumental in Micron Technology\u2019s plans to set up a chip plant in the country. What Next After a major crash involving multiple trains in Odisha, Vaishnaw was on the ground, leading the recovery work. However, the incident again put the limelight on railway safety and security, which would be a key task for him going ahead, including quickly rolling out the Kavach anti-collision system for as many trains as possible. He also has to ensure a smooth rollout of Vande Bharat metro and sleeper versions and chase up the groundwork for the first stretch of theMumbai-Ahmedabadhigh-speed train from Billimora toSurat. Social media quotientX: @AshwiniVaishnaw 1.4M followers 14)Himanta Biswa Sarma, 55Chief Minister, Assam Why Both active and combative on social media, Himanta Biswa Sarma is one of the most talked-about CMs in the country and the face of the BJP in the Northeast, a region where the party did not have much of a presence till recently. Sarma\u2019s footprint can also be felt beyond the region now, with the BJP using him as an integral part of its campaign in other state elections. Power Punch After Rahul Gandhi\u2019s Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra took off from conflict-ridden Manipur, in a pointed message to the Modi government, Sarma ensured it had a tough run through Assam, keeping it embroiled in disputes. Recently, the Assam CM played a key role in the peace accord signed between the ULFA\u2019s pro-talks faction and the Centre. Sarma had multiple rounds of formal and informal discussions with its leaders to bring them on board. What Next The only BJP CM who is a part of the party\u2019s key Lok Sabha election strategy committee and joining committee, Sarma is expected to be a key weapon for the party against Rahul. Social media quotientX: @himantabiswa 2.3M followers 15) Mamata Banerjee, 69Chief Minister, West Bengal; TMC chief Why Banerjee is currently the only woman CM and one of the most powerful Opposition leaders. A staunch critic of the BJP-led government at the Centre, the TMC supremo followed up on her victory against the BJP in the 2021 Assembly polls with a landslide win in panchayat polls in the state last year. Power Punch Refusing to yield on her decision to leave only two Lok Sabha seats for the Congress in the coming elections, Mamata took the call to go it alone in the state. Accusing the Congress of acting under the influence of the Left, she again established that the BJP\u2019s heat on her notwithstanding, she could not be taken for granted. What Next Under constant attack from the BJP and the Left-Congress alliance in the state over corruption allegations and charges of highhandedness towards Opposition workers, Mamata has a point to prove in the coming Lok Sabha elections. The results are likely to set the tone for the 2026 Assembly polls, with the BJP expected to turn the screws in if it makes further gains from its surprising 18-Lok Sabha seat haul in 2019. Social media quotientX: @MamataOfficial 7.3M followers 16) Rahul Gandhi, 53Congress leader, MP Why A reversal of (mis)fortune for the Congress is key to the Opposition countering the BJP\u2019s march. So all eyes, even those of his reluctant allies, are on Rahul Gandhi. Pilloried by critics, often called his party\u2019s problem rather than the solution, as electoral success continues to elude him, Rahul has his challenge framed. His is the most consistent political voice against the BJP/RSS and PM Narendra Modi. How much of an echo it has will only be known come elections as he works to put the first pieces of the INDIA coalition into place. Power Punch His decision to embark on the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra on the eve of the Lok Sabha elections was presented as a fait accompli to theCongress Working Committee. Many in the Opposition INDIA bloc and some within the Congress felt the timing was inappropriate, but the party had no option but to agree. What Next The 2024 Lok Sabha elections are a crucial battle for Rahul, who has now been at the helm of affairs in the Congress since Modi\u2019s rise. The party hopes to cross the three-digit mark, with even its hopeful well-wishers not dreaming of a win. Another overwhelming defeat \u2014 the third, after 44 seats in 2014, and 52 in 2019 \u2014 could wreck the Congress and damage Rahul irrevocably. Social media quotientX: @RahulGandhi 25M followers 17) Ajit Doval, 79National Security Advisor Why After a decade in the Modi government, Ajit Doval remains among the Prime Minister\u2019s most trusted aides on matters of security and diplomacy. His advice is regularly sought by the government while making key appointments in Central police organisations. Apart from shaping India\u2019s policy on Pakistan and China, Doval has played a key role in building India\u2019s relations in the Gulf. Now, he has the onerous task of finding a way out of the diplomatic tough spot with Canada and the US, amid accusations by the two countries of Indian agents trying to carry out assassinations in their territories. Doval will also have an eye on China, which is determined to firm up a new status quo on theLine of Actual Control. Power Punch The release of eight former Naval officers facing the death row in Qatar is said to have been worked out by Doval in close coordination with External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, under the directions of Modi. India\u2019s willingness to deal with the Taliban in Afghanistan is also understood to have been influenced by the NSA\u2019s understanding of pragmatic regional politics. What Next The key question in a Modi 3.0 government will be whether Doval will stay on as the NSA. He turns 80 next year. Social media quotientNot on social media 18) Arvind Kejriwal, 55Chief Minister, Delhi ; AAP Supremo Why Arvind Kejriwal helms the youngest national party in the country, with its presence in the legislatures of Delhi, Punjab, Gujarat andGoa. By forging an alliance with the Congress in Delhi for the Lok Sabha polls, Kejriwal is looking to further his influence. Power Punch His trusted deputy and senior colleagues in jail for alleged corruption, Kejriwal has stood firm returning to the AAP\u2019s core issues like power, water and education in tune with his goal of providing everyone with \u201cbaseline\u201d facilities for free. As the Enforcement Directorate tightens the net around him in the Delhi excise policy probe, Kejriwal\u2019s refrain has been how the Centre is using agencies to tie him down. And how leaders crossing over to the BJP get the whitewash \u201cclean chit.\u201d What Next The BJP won all seven seats in the Capital in 2014 and 2019. In Punjab, where it is also in power, the AAP has decided to go alone. How the party fares in the Lok Sabha polls will impact its national standing. The stand-off between him and the ED, where the matter is in court after he has skipped six summons sent by the agency, will also have a significant impact on the party and its governments in Delhi and Punjab. SOCIAL MEDIA QUOTIENTX: @ArvindKejriwal 27.3M followers 19) Shaktikanta Das, 67Governor, Reserve Bank of India Why Shaktikanta Das took over charge of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in December 2018. As the 25th Governor of the RBI, he has been guiding the monetary policy and banking sector efficiently for more than five years. Under his leadership, the Indian economy has come out of various domestic and global challenges such as theCovid-19pandemic, theUkraine-Russia war and conflict in the Middle East, with minimal impact. Power Punch Das has taken bold measures to ensure a stable macro-economic environment. He has brought in critical reforms in banking, NBFCs (non-banking financial companies) and fintech sectors, which have strengthened the domestic financial system. After raising therepo rateby 250 basis points between May 2022 and February 2023, Das has not hiked the key policy rate last year. This has given some respite to borrowers as the interest rates on their home or vehicle or personal loans have not risen. Noting that \u201cnavigating the \u2018last mile\u2019 of disinflation could be sticky,\u201d he doesn\u2019t believe in premature moves. What Next The key challenge for Das in 2024 will be to bring consumer price-based inflation to the four per cent target while also supporting growth. SOCIAL MEDIA QUOTIENTX: @DasShaktikanta 220.7K followers 20) Hardeep Singh Puri, 72Union Minister of Housing & Urban Affairs and Petroleum & Natural Gas Why In his capacity as the Union Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister, and amid criticism from some European countries, Hardeep Puri has staunchly defended India\u2019s high oil imports from Russia, since the war in Ukraine began two years ago. He asserted that India\u2019s energy needs are the government\u2019s priority and should not be mixed with geopolitics. As the Union Minister of Housing and Urban Affairs, Puri oversaw the construction of the new Parliament building, which was inaugurated on May 28, 2023. Power Punch Over the past year, Puri has seen through two high-profile projects, the new Parliament and the Bharat Mandapam convention centre that hosted the G20 Summit in Delhi last September. What Next The Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry under Puri is getting ready to complete the Common Central Secretariat and the new Prime Minister\u2019s Office and PM\u2019s residence. SOCIAL MEDIA QUOTIENTX: @HardeepSPuri 602.5K followers 21) Sanjiv Khanna, 64Supreme Court Judge Why Due to be Chief Justice of India in November 2024, his six-month tenure, in the first year of the new government, will be keenly watched. Power Punch Elevated from the Delhi High Court, he is among the few to enter the Supreme Court without becoming a Chief Justice of a High Court. He was part of the Bench that ruled on a hate speechFIRagainst a journalist saying that in a plural world, \u201chate speech cannot conceivably contribute in any legitimate way to democracy and, in fact, repudiates the right to equality.\u201d He was part of the Bench that cleared the Central Vista Project. He was on the Constitution Bench upholding the abrogation of Article 370 and striking down the 2018 electoral bonds scheme. What Next As he steps into the large shoes of his predecessor, he will have to maintain a fine balance between judicial independence and the government\u2019s concerns. As CJI, he will make recommendations to fill up at least two vacancies of judges that are expected to come up in his tenure. SOCIAL MEDIA QUOTIENTNot on social media 22) Siddaramaiah, 76Chief Minister, Karnataka  Why The senior Congress leader became Karnataka Chief Minister for the second time in May 2023. He helped the Congress win 135 of 224 Assembly seats. Siddaramaiah, with his organisational control, will play an important role if the Congress wants to outperform the BJP in the Lok Sabha elections in the state. In 2019, the BJP had won 26 of the state\u2019s 28 Lok Sabha seats, including Mandya that was won by an Independent backed by the party. Power Punch Siddaramaiah remains one of the tallest leaders in the faction-ridden Karnataka Congress. After the elections, he overcame a strong challenge from state Congress president D K Shivakumar for the Chief Minister\u2019s post. With the support of over 80 per cent of Congress MLAs as well as the party high command, he clinched the top job. Shivakumar became Deputy Chief Minister. A member of the Kuruba community, he is crucial to the Congress\u2019s OBC outreach in the state. What Next A strong performance for the Congress in the Lok Sabha polls in the state will not only be invaluable for the party, it will also help Siddaramaiah strengthen his hold on the CM\u2019s chair for a full five-year tenure even as Shivakumar will push for a change after two-and-a-half years. SOCIAL MEDIA QUOTIENTX: @siddaramaiah 1M followers 23)\u00a0 Mansukh\u00a0Mandaviya, 51Minister of Health and Family Welfare; Chemicals and Fertilisers Why As Health Minister, he has been responsible for implementing the government\u2019s flagship schemes such as the Ayushman Bharat health insurance and launching Janaushadhi Kendras, centres which provide quality medicines at affordable prices. With a goal of ensuring that Ayushman Bharat cards reach beneficiaries, he\u2019s part of the Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra. Over 2.6 crore cards have been issued and over 10,000 Janaushadhi Kendras set up, which he hopes to increase to 25,000. These have been estimated to have helped people and saved nearly Rs 25,000 crore in 10 years. Power Punch Mandaviya has pushed for indigenous manufacturing, research and development. As chemicals and fertiliser minister, he is pushing for self-sufficiency with nano urea and nano DAP. What Next He wants to roll out a CoWIN-like vaccine management platform for other shots across the country.

At present, hisJanata Dal(United) is third behind theRashtriya Janata Dal(RJD) and the BJP in terms of its Assembly tally. Nitish\u2019s political acumen and ability to manoeuvre his party have seen him become Bihar\u2019s longest-serving Chief Minister. Power Punch Nitish may well have punctured the INDIA bloc of Opposition parties. Last year, he took the initiative to bring them together against the BJP. With Nitish back in its camp, the BJP-led NDA will feel confident of its social combination trumping that of the Mahagathbandhan and improving its tally. Whether he is with the BJP or the RJD, Nitish has maintained his primacy in Bihar\u2019s tripolar politics for 18 years now.\u00a0And still seems to be retaining his core Kurmi votebase. Besides, he is among chief ministers who have scored on the development index. What Next Nitish\u2019s immediate goal will be to win a good number of seats in the Lok Sabha elections, so that he can increase his leverage and remain politically relevant. SOCIAL MEDIA QUOTIENTX: @NitishKumar 8.5M followers 25) MK Stalin, 70Chief Minister, Tamil Nadu Why After the death of his father and DMK founder MKarunanidhi,\u00a0MK Stalin has emerged as the party\u2019s undisputed leader. Under his stewardship, the DMK secured major electoral victories in the Lok Sabha elections in 2019 and the Assembly polls in 2021. He is also a key Opposition face nationally, the DMK being a major constituent of the INDIA alliance. He has been consistent about protecting the federal nature of the Indian polity. Power Punch Stalin could play a vital role in the national Opposition landscape, given his rapport with several chief ministers, from Kerala\u2019sPinarayi Vijayanto Delhi\u2019s Arvind Kejriwal. He has spoken for unity among regional parties to forge a formidable front against the BJP and registered protests against the Centre over issues such as delimitation. He has stood by protesting farmers, saying while the BJP has been attacking them, the DMK government in Tamil Nadu has been drafting programmes for their welfare. Furthermore, his tenure has been marked by an absence of significant controversies. What Next The DMK is focusing on consolidating its voter base in Tamil Nadu. In partnership with the Congress, the Left and other smaller outfits, it looks like the tide is in its favour in the state.

An educationist, philanthropist, businesswoman, arts patron, she is an IPL team and football league owner, who is at the front and centre of a rapidly growing Indian sports industry. Power Punch Ambani envisioned the Nita Mukesh Ambani Cultural Centre (NMACC), a sprawling cultural hub in Mumbai that showcases varied art forms. It has become the one-stop destination for artists, both Indian and international, with Broadway-style musicals and showstopping exhibitions. The all-important IOC Session, where India made clear its ambitions to host the 2036 Olympics, was also hosted at the Reliance-owned Jio World Centre in Mumbai last October. PM Modi formally announced India\u2019s bid to host the 2036 Olympics here. What Next The country will be setting up an \u2018India House\u2019 in Paris to push its case for hosting the Games and Ambani is believed to be personally involved in its planning. SOCIAL MEDIA QUOTIENTNot on social media 27) Shah Rukh Khan, 58Actor Why It\u2019s rare for any movie star to bounce back after a five-year trough but Shah Rukh Khan did that with elan, and in the process, pulled the Hindi film industry out of the post-Covid slump. Not only that, he sealed his position as a cinematic legend, helming three larger-than-life roles in back-to-back films consistently. A smart businessman and a sought-after brand ambassador, he almost has first citizen status in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. Power Punch Both Pathaan and Jawan went on to make massive earnings worldwide and created new records for Hindi cinema. Dunki, paler by comparison, still did over Rs 200 crore. He got his fans back to theatres and as the cigar-smoking Vikram Rathore in Jawan, laid the template for an ageless Hollywoodian superhero. What Next Khan is likely to play his own age in an action thriller called King, where he will co-star with daughter Suhana Khan. There\u2019s India\u2019s biggest action film, Tiger v/s Pathaan, withSalman Khan. He\u2019s likely to work with more directors from the South. SOCIAL MEDIA QUOTIENTX: @iamsrk 44M followers 28) Natarajan Chandrasekaran, 60Chairperson, Tata Group Why The Chairperson of the Tata Group, a conglomerate with a combined market capitalisation of $337 billion, N Chandrasekaran is also a former CEO of Tata Consultancy Services, India\u2019s largest IT company. Under his leadership, the group has undertaken the 3S strategy \u2014 simplification, synergy and scale \u2014 to consolidate its myriad businesses. Power Punch Among the highest paid corporate executives in India, with a remuneration of Rs 113 crore in FY23, Chandrasekaran is responsible for revitalising Air India, expanding the group\u2019s footprint in the consumer space through big-ticket acquisitions and digitising its industrial operations. His role in overseeing the group\u2019s committed capex of $90 billion over the next few years cannot be understated. The group has become the first Indian iPhone assembler. What Next Manufacturing 5G equipment, setting up a 20 gigawatt factory for lithium-ion batteries in Gujarat and integrating services of all group companies in a super app, Tata Neu, are set to define the group\u2019s future. SOCIAL MEDIA QUOTIENTNot on social media 29)Sonia Gandhi, 77Senior Congress leader Why DespiteMallikarjun Khargeholding the reins of the Congress and Rahul Gandhi being its face, Sonia\u2019s is still the last word in the party. Health concerns might have led to her deciding not to contest in the Lok Sabha elections but the fact that she will be a Rajya Sabha MP shows she will very much remain in public life. The Congress will value that presence as Sonia remains a respected figure across the Opposition spectrum. This will be crucial as the Congress irons out differences over seat-sharing with allies. Power Punch After the Telangana Congress leadership opposed Y S Sharmila\u2019s entry into the party, as did the Andhra unit, it was Sonia who ensured she joined the party and persuaded her to focus on Andhra \u2014 even if that pitted her against her estranged brother and Andhra Chief Minister YSJagan Mohan Reddy. What Next Given her health, she may not campaign for the elections, but, an active parliamentarian, Sonia is expected to take her duties in the Rajya Sabha seriously. And in the not-very likely scenario of the Lok Sabha elections throwing up a fractured mandate, she will be in the thick of the political action. Social media quotientNot on social media 30) Rahul Navin, 56Acting Director, Enforcement Directorate Why Rahul Navin, the seniormost officer in the Enforcement Directorate (ED), is officiating as the director of the agency following the retirement of Sanjay Mishra in September last year. The ED has been accused of targeting leaders of the Opposition and whitewashing those who cross over. Mishra set the momentum, Navin is keeping pace. Power Punch Under Navin, for the first time, the agency literally chased a sitting chief minister,Hemant Soren, over charges of money laundering and arrested him minutes after his resignation. It is now pursuing Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, who, like Soren, has been defying ED summons. Many Opposition politicians who have joined the BJP in the past few years have ED cases against them. What Next Navin has the onerous task of ensuring the credibility of the agency. To that effect, he will have to prosecute corruption cases irrespective of party lines and hold accountable ED staff accused of alleged extortion. It is learnt that he and his predecessor share a good relationship and Navin continues to seek Mishra\u2019s guidance. Social media quotientNot on social media 31) Bhupender Yadav, 54Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change Why Bhupender Yadav played an important role in the BJP\u2019s victories in the 2023 Assembly elections, including in his home state of Rajasthan. As the election in-charge of Madhya Pradesh, he led efforts to ensure the BJP held on to power in the key Hindi heartland state. As the Environment Minister, Yadav led negotiations at the global climate talks to safeguard India\u2019s interests. India also pledged to reach net zero emissions by 2070 at COP26 in 2021. India\u2019s climate actions were rated the fourth strongest in an annual performance index released by Germanwatch in 2023, up one place from the previous year. Power Punch MP polls, the challenge of anti-incumbency, took much of Yadav\u2019s time in 2023; the BJP victory was his most satisfying moment. What Next He is part of the party\u2019s high-level team that finalises strategies for the general elections. His current ministerial portfolio will also be one of the most sought after since India is planning to host the global climate conference in 2028. Social media quotientX: @byadavbjp 575.3K followers 32)Anurag Thakur, 49Minister of Information and Broadcasting, Sports and Youth Affairs Why As Union Minister for Information and Broadcasting, Thakur\u00a0is the voice of the government, communicating important policy decisions, setting the narrative and doing damage control in adverse situations. His portfolio of Youth and Sports Affairs makes him key to the government\u2019s efforts to gain traction among the youth as the BJP eyes the support of over two crore first-time voters in the upcoming elections. Power Punch In the 24\u00d77 cycle of social media, he has fielded, many a time at instant notice, to counter tough opponents. He enjoys a rapport with the new leadership in states by virtue of his long association with the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM), of which he was the president. What Next As part of preparations for 2024 polls, the BJP has shortlisted some constituencies as tough seats. Thakur has the responsibility of such seats in Maharashtra. He has also been tasked with helping the BJP win in his home turf of Himachal Pradesh, which the party lost in the 2022 Assembly elections. Social media quotientX: @ianuragthakur 2.4M followers 33)Dharmendra Pradhan, 54Minister of Education Why Dharmendra Pradhan has been spearheading the Centre\u2019s effort to execute the National Education Policy (NEP), 2020, since assuming office as Education Minister in 2021. He is the fourth minister to hold the portfolio since the BJP came to power in 2014. He also holds the key Skill Development and Entrepreneurship portfolio that has gained importance under NEP 2020. Pradhan is one of the most-respected leaders among the party cadre. Power Punch Pradhan oversaw measures to mitigate learning losses due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The National Curriculum Framework (NCF) was introduced during his term and the National Credit Framework (NCrF) is also being rolled out under his watch. What Next The largest revision of school textbooks based on the new NCF is underway and several textbooks are expected to be ready this year. As he prepares to contest the Lok Sabha election from Odisha, he will have to establish himself as the face of the BJP in the state. Social media quotientX: @dpradhanbjp 1.9M followers 34) Dattatreya Hosabale, 69General Secretary, RSS Why Ahead of the Lok Sabha polls, Hosabale, as the executive head of the RSS, will remain a crucial figure mobilising cadres to bolster the BJP\u2019s campaign. He has his headquarters inLucknowand will be expected to deliver a rich electoral harvest in the Hindi heartland. Power Punch Though elections are scheduled this year within the RSS,\u00a0Hosabale\u00a0is expected to be retained as Sarkaryawah given that next year the Sangh will be celebrating its centenary. Under Hosabale, the RSS has been able to considerably expand its influence in south India, where the BJP is still considered to be weak. While he continues to influence government policy on key issues and has a say in appointments in educational institutions, he has been consistently underlining growing economic inequality in the country and rising unemployment as matters of great concern. Hosabale, like Bhagwat, has a direct line with the PM. What Next In the backdrop of the caste census demand, the RSS launched the samajik samrasta (social harmony) programme to create a narrative of Hindu society being one. Its success would be watched for its impact on polls. Social media quotientX: @DattaHosabale 68.3K followers 35) Jay Shah, 35BCCI secretary Why Easily the most powerful man in world cricket, BCCI secretary Jay Shah has strengthened India\u2019s claim of influencing every decision that the sport takes. Son of Union Home Minister Amit Shah, Jay launched the Women\u2019s Premier League and led the way in successfully conducting last year\u2019s 50-over World Cup. He was also instrumental in taking cricket to the Olympics. Power Punch Already the youngest Asian Cricket Council (ACC) chief, he is in line to become the International Cricket Council (ICC) chairman. Shah played a big role in the BCCI\u2019s share of ICC\u2019s revenues nearly doubling \u2014 from 22.8 per cent to 38.5 per cent. This means the BCCI will now get $231 million annually from the international body. The BCCI secretary also got his way during last year\u2019s Asia Cup, refusing to allow India to travel to Pakistan and forcing the hosts to travel to a neutral venue to play India. Shah has unprecedented control over the BCCI that was once known for its intense power struggles and factional fighting. What Next Set to be the ICC chairman this year, he will decide the course cricket takes as it enters the world\u2019s biggest sports market \u2014 the US where cricket takes its first serious step this year with the World T20 in June. Social media quotientInstagram: @jayshah220988 600K followers 36) Mallikarjun Kharge, 81President,Indian National Congress Why As the leader of the Congress in the Lok Sabha after the 2014 polls, Kharge made his mark as a forceful voice in a House where his party was reduced to its lowest tally of 44 seats. Since winning the party president post in 2022, he has pulled his weight, most recently, in picking the party\u2019s Tamil Nadu chief. Power Punch At the INDIA bloc meetings held a couple of months ago to work out the creases in the alliance, some of the members hinted that they might not be averse to him as the face of the group. Kharge, as a credible Dalit face, was seen as carrying enough heft at a time when the INDIA bloc was making social justice its main poll plank. What Next With the INDIA bloc disintegrating and several big ticket names exiting the Congress, the biggest challenge before Kharge is to resolve seat-sharing tussles and stitch together a credible campaign against the BJP in the coming Lok Sabha elections. Party leaders say Rahul\u2019s Yatra has been a boon in that sense, hogging the limelight, letting Kharge work quietly behind the scenes. Social media quotientX: @kharge 595.5K followers 37) Azim Premji, 78Founder,Wipro Why Former chairman of IT major Wipro, Azim Premji far outshines other Indian billionaires when it comes to philanthropy. After becoming the first Indian to sign the \u2018Giving Pledge\u2019, which encourages wealthy individuals to pledge half their fortunes to philanthropy in 2013, Premji has pledged a record $7.6 billion stake in Wipro to the Azim Premji Foundation, that funds NGOs, works for marginalised people and facilitates primary education in India. Power Punch Over the years, Azim Premji has invested in several startups across sectors, including GlobalBees that has achieved unicorn status. Wipro is one of the biggest IT companies in India with a market cap of over Rs 2,79,000 crore. The company signed a massive Rs 8,286-crore deal withIntelFoundry this year for chip designs that will be used by customers in the automotive, industrial and telecoms verticals and in generative AI-driven designs. What Next The Premji-led Azim Premji Foundation this year secured 150 acres in Jharkhand\u2019s Ranchi for development of one of the biggest educational hubs in the country. The foundation will also work with the state government in various other sectors for sustainable development. Social media quotientNot on social media 38)Virat Kohli, 35India batsman Why He is no longer the Indian captain nor an important decision-maker but there is no bigger name in Indian cricket than Virat Kohli. After battling a tough couple of years with the bat, Kohli found his second wind in 2023, repositioning himself as the best of his generation. Be it against Pakistan at the Asia Cup or right through the World Cup, when he became the first batsman to score 50 ODI centuries, Kohli once again made it a habit to score runs when India needed him the most. Power Punch There is no bigger brand in cricket than Kohli. With 266 million followers on Instagram, he has unparalleled power to influence opinions and habits. At most stadiums where India plays, fans with Kohli T-shirts are in a majority. There is a drop in the decibel level in the stands when Kohli is missing. Hence, broadcasters pray for Kohli\u2019s presence at all games India plays. He also enjoys great respect from his peers and former players around the world. What Next A World T20 trophy this year will help him silence the voices that question his form in ICC event knockout games. His other challenge will be to guide the next generation of cricketers. Social media quotientInstagram: @virat.kohli 266 M followers 39) AnumulaRevanth Reddy, 54Chief Minister, Telangana Why Revanth Reddy is the first CM of Telangana from the Congress. He almost single-handedly led the party\u2019s turnaround in the Assembly elections last year, dislodging the Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) government. Within days of taking oath, he launched four of the six guarantees that his party had promised. His government has been claiming to unravel alleged financial irregularities in projects launched by the BRS government. Power Punch Having joined the Congress from the TDP in October 2017, Reddy fought competition within the party to become the state Congress chief. His power-packed speeches have made him one of the most popular leaders in state, overshadowing KCR. What Next Reddy needs to manoeuvre the state out of financial distress, caused by the alleged overspending on welfare schemes and projects of the previous BRS government. He also needs to ensure availability of funds to implement the Congress\u2019s six guarantees. Social media quotientX: @revanth_anumula 509.8K followers 40) Vinai Kumar\u00a0Saxena, 65Lieutenant Governor, Delhi Why From taking charge of the Capital\u2019s administration following an Ordinance, which later became a law, bringing the bureaucracy in the city under his direct control, to hitting the ground first for G20 Summit preparations and then overseeing its smooth execution, VK Saxena has been in the driver\u2019s seat in the Capital. Power Punch Strongly worded letters to Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal holding Delhi government departments to book \u2014 that too publicly \u2014 and signing off on action against bureaucrats, government officials and AAP leaders for \u201cirregularities\u201d, Saxena has regularly made headlines in a state that is governed by a party with an overwhelming legislative majority. What Next Several of Saxena\u2019s ideas, including a scheme for village development, anti-encroachment drives across the city and demolition of premises linked to alleged drug peddlers, are being implemented since he was placed at the helm of services above its elected government. The AAP\u2019s challenge to the Central law will be closely watched by everyone, especially Saxena, as it directly affects his role in the Capital\u2019s governance.

He launched a non-banking finance company, Kotak Mahindra Finance, in 1985, which was later converted into a commercial bank in 2003. Power Punch Kotak has played a pivotal role in the success of the Kotak Mahindra group in the last 38 years. It has emerged as a diversified and integrated financial services conglomerate, with a presence in various financial services such as banking, asset management, alternate asset management, life and general insurance, stock broking, investment banking, microfinance and asset reconstruction. Kotak Mahindra has become the fourth largest private sector lender in the country. Throughout his career, Kotak has been vocal about issues facing the banking sector and the financial sector regulations. He was one of the few who spoke about his concerns on demonetisation.

Power Punch Nilekani has been a vocal advocate of employing technology-based governance delivery systems and digital public infrastructure (DPI) for India to achieve its economic, social and environmental ambitions. India has developed enviable digital public infrastructure over the past few years and Nilekani has been among its key architects. What Next Nilekani co-founded Beckn that is behind the government-backed Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC), which is being developed as an alternative to e-commerce giants operating in India. A scale-up of ONDC and wider adoption of the Beckn protocol will be keenly watched.

He ranked 91 in the annual richest list published by Forbes magazine in 2022. He played a key role in transforming the company into a global brand. Under Mahindra, the group also got a makeover with the introduction of a new logo in 2000 and the same year saw the launch of Mahindra Bolero and then Mahindra Scorpio in 2002. From tractors and jeeps, the Mahindra Group expanded into IT, aerospace, hospitality, and more. In 2010, Mahindra sponsored the FIFA World Cup and later in 2014, it entered FIA Formula E Championships. Mahindra is now playing a significant role in the group\u2019s expansion into Electric Vehicle (EV) manufacturing renewable solar projects. Power Punch Mahindra Defence Systems (MDS), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mahindra & Mahindra, has begun delivering Armored Light Specialist Vehicles (ALSVs) built for the Indian armed forces.

At the same time, he has inherited his father\u2019s fiery spirit and is one of the few voices of corporate India who doesn\u2019t fear calling a spade a spade. Having earlier criticised the Covid-19 lockdowns as hurting the GDP, he spoke his mind against subsidies for EVs in India. He believes that our EV policies need sound strategy and not subsidies, which disrupt innovation. Power Punch Though Bajaj Auto is second to Hero Motocorp in terms of the number of bikes sold, it\u2019s number one in terms of market capitalisation, currently around Rs 2.35 lakh crore. He has announced the launch of the \u2018biggest Pulsar ever.\u2019 The company had a 38 per cent jump in profits for the third quarter and declared a Rs 4,000-crore share buyback.

At 26, he has virtually won every global title possible \u2014 with the most recent being India\u2019s first World Championship gold. Power Punch Recovering from a groin injury that forced him to pull out of the 2022 Commonwealth Games, the javelin star registered another stellar season, becoming the first athlete from the country to win a World Championship gold. He was the first notable athlete to raise his voice for wrestlers protesting in the national capital before others joined in. He has also emerged as the most sought-after non-cricket athlete for brand endorsements. What Next In his own words, \u201cthrowers don\u2019t have a finish line\u201d. He is a favourite to win gold at the Paris Olympics this summer. He will surely be looking to tick off the 90m box as well this season.

A win, which looks quite certain at this moment, will make him the longest-serving CM in the country. Patnaik is considered to have a good rapport with Prime Minister Narendra Modi despite his claim of being \u2018equidistant\u2019 from the BJP and the Congress. Power Punch Patnaik has managed to stay away from any controversy and maintained his \u201cclean image\u201d despite being at the helm of uninterrupted power for around 24 years. Politician of a rare kind, Patnaik refrains from making rhetoric speeches and direct attacks on Opposition leaders. His humility is his biggest asset that has helped him retain the confidence of the people of the state, besides his slew of welfare measures. What Next Amid debate on his successor, Patnaik\u2019s closest aide and his former private secretary VK Pandian, who resigned from the IAS in October last year, joined the ruling BJD. Despite not holding any position, Pandian, a native of Tamil Nadu, is considered to be the second-most powerful leader in the BJD after Patnaik.

Within a short span of taking over as Chief Minister, he has not only taken charge of his organisation that has been recognised as the real Shiv Sena but has also managed to hold his own in the coalition government, emerging from the shadow of the Thackerays. Mixing guile with tact, he has kept many a line open to the BJP\u2019s key leaders. Power Punch By taking the centre stage in addressing the fraught issue of Maratha reservation, he has tried to establish himself as the community leader. The draft notification promising Kunbi certificate to eligible Marathas and their blood relatives was seen as a masterstroke. The Maharashtra Assembly on February 20 passed a Bill approving 10 per cent reservation to Marathas in government jobs and education. What Next The task before Shinde is to consolidate and expand his party. His leadership has yet to be tested in an electoral battle with Uddhav Thackeray. His acceptance among party cadre at the grassroots across Maharashtra remains a litmus test. Social media quotientX: @mieknathsinde 1M followers 49) Pinarayi Vijayan, 78Chief Minister, Kerala Why The head of the only Communist government in the country now, Pinarayi Vijayan remains one of the most powerful regional voices against the Narendra Modi government. Having returned the LDF to power for an unprecedented second consecutive term in Kerala, Pinarayi is not just in full control of the government but also the once-divided CPI(M) in the state. He is among the leading Opposition CMs who have fashioned themselves as champions of federalism, opening battlefronts \u2014 including in the Supreme Court \u2014 against the Governor and the Central government. Power Punch Putting behind the decades-long water dispute between Kerala and Tamil Nadu, Pinarayi has forged a close partnership with his Tamil Nadu counterpart M K Stalin. The two meet often and have supported each other in their respective struggles against the BJP-led Centre, laying the groundwork for the formation of a Southern alliance of CMs. What Next The 2024 Lok Sabha polls are different as the CPI(M) is tied to the Congress via the INDIA bloc now. However, Pinarayi\u00a0has made it clear that he would not go easy on the Congress in Kerala, and his immediate focus is to limit the Congress to single digits and win seats for the CPI(M).

Despite having to sacrifice the CM\u2019s position twice, he\u2019s the glue that keeps the coalition together. Power Punch Having succeeded in breaking the Shiv Sena in 2022, he managed to engineer a split in the NCP in July 2023 and got the faction led by Ajit Pawar to join the government. Within 15 months, hence, he has weakened two major regional parties in the state. What Next The Lok Sabha, Assembly and civic body elections are the challenges ahead. He has been tasked with ensuring a repeat of 2019 (the then NDA won 41 of the 48 Lok Sabha seats) in 2024 ensuring the alliance remains intact.

In many a courtoom battle, he has become the go-to person for many BJP-ruled states, from Manipur to Uttar Pradesh, and also for the Centre in Opposition-ruled states such as West Bengal. Power Punch Mehta led the arguments in the crucial challenge against the abrogation of Article 370 of the Constitution that gave special status to Kashmir. In a rare move, he issued a statement after the apex court put its stamp of approval on the government\u2019s move, highlighting his role on the issue. Mehta said he was \u201cthe only lawyer involved in the process of abrogation of Article 370 through constitutional and legal means before August 5, 2019 and led the arguments\u201d before the top court. What Next Since Mehta has won more cases than he has lost for the government, it is to be seen what the new government might hold for him, should the NDA come back to power. SOCIAL MEDIA QUOTIENTNot on social media 52) PK Mishra, 75Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister Why A 1972-batch Gujarat cadre Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer, Pramod Kumar Mishra is the country\u2019s top bureaucrat. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is said to consult him while taking all crucial decisions, especially senior-level appointments. Power Punch PK Mishra has been at the helm of affairs in the Prime Minister\u2019s Office (PMO) for the last 10 years and has shared a special rapport with Prime Minister Modi since the latter\u2019s days as Gujarat Chief Minister. In 2014, during the Modi government\u2019s first tenure, a special post of additional principal secretary was created in the PMO to accommodate Mishra. His high-speed growth model is both inclusive and innovative. What Next As the Modi government seeks a third term, Mishra\u2019s foremost task will be to ensure that the pace of development and governance remains smooth ahead of the general elections this year. He believes that India should move forward, become \u2018self-reliant\u2019 in all aspects and prioritise sustainable development. He will have a key role in ensuring India reaches its goal of becoming a developed nation by 2047. SOCIAL MEDIA QUOTIENTNot on social media 53)Manoj Sinha, 64Lieutenant Governor, Jammu and Kashmir Why Manoj Sinha has been at the helm in J&K for over three years now. Over the past year, he has enhanced public engagement, sometimes addressing multiple events the same day. Targeted killings, protests by Kashmiri Pandits and the Gujjar/Bakerwal communities have been challenges for him in the absence of elected leaders in Jammu and Kashmir. Directed by the Centre, he is driving the infrastructure push in the region. The tourism group meeting of the G20 in Srinagar was a new feather in his cap. Power Punch Sinha has been focused on effective administration during his tenure. His fortnightly feature, the \u201cL-G Mulaqat\u201d, is a hit. The entire administration meets via video-conferencing and complaints submitted via the LG\u2019s grievance cell are taken up for resolution. Given the lack of direct representation in the state, in terms of elected leaders, many people have taken the LG grievance cell route. He also meets a wide range of people in his offices in both Srinagar and Jammu. What Next As the Supreme Court has set a September deadline for Assembly elections in J&K, helping start the political process and bridging local mistrust will be Sinha\u2019s next challenge.

PhonePe\u2019s total payments value (TPV) market share for UPI payments stood at 50.54 per cent in March 2023. The number of registered users recently crossed the 500 million mark. The company also completed its full spinoff from theFlipkartgroup and moved its domicile to India from Singapore. Power Punch PhonePe became the first fintech company to allow cross-border money transfers through UPI. Despite a funding winter that impacted a number of startups, PhonePe managed to raise $350 million last year, valuing it around $12 billion. It launched a shopping app called Pincode, focused on hyperlocal e-commerce on the government-backed ONDC platform. What Next As its biggest competitorPaytmfaces a slew of regulatory challenges, it is upon Nigam to navigate the company in a growing market. He will also have to improve PhonePe\u2019s unit economics as the company heads for an eventual public listing. The company has launched its own app store to challenge the might and control ofAppleandGooglein the space.

A favourite of the RSS, the former state higher education minister is set to emerge as an alternative OBC face to reduce Chouhan\u2019s imprint in the state. Power Punch Despite lobbying by several powerful factions within the BJP, Yadav, his supporters say, managed to wrest the CM\u2019s chair because of his grassroots connect. He cut his teeth in student politics and has his ear to the ground. He belongs to the Malwa Nimar region that has 66 crucial Assembly seats and is a bellwether region of the state. His OBC credentials have also been used by the BJP to campaign in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar to reach out to that caste base. What Next After a series of transfers of senior IAS and IPS officers, Yadav has to get the state\u2019s finances in order as the exchequer is burdened with welfare schemes introduced in the Chouhan era. Also on his plate is the challenge to help the party repeat its 2019 sweep (28 of 29 seats) in 2024. SOCIAL MEDIA QUOTIENTX: @DrMohanYadav51 339.6K followers 56) YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, 51Chief Minister, Andhra Pradesh Why Five years after his landslide victory in the simultaneous Lok Sabha and Assembly elections in Andhra Pradesh, Jagan Mohan Reddy remains one of the most popular leaders in the state. The YSRCP government has disbursed Rs 2.55 lakh crore as direct benefit transfers (DBT) and Rs 1.07 lakh crore as non-DBT aid through several welfare schemes, dubbed Navaratnalu (nine gems). Governance and welfare schemes have been taken to people\u2019s doorsteps through his innovative village and ward secretariats, strengthening his popular connect. Power Punch Sensing anti-incumbency, Jagan has started dropping sitting MLAs who he feels do not have a good chance of winning as he aims for 175 seats. So far, there has been no rebellion in response. What Next He faces a challenge from the TDP-JSP combine and the BJP as theChandrababu Naidu-led party tries to get its former ally on board. His new rival is his sister and Andhra Congress chief YS Sharmila. He has to balance finances with populist schemes.

Chairperson of India\u2019s first private museum of modern and contemporary art, she has supported numerous prestigious exhibitions of Indian art at international institutions. Wife of industrialist Shiv Nadar, her collection of over 13,000 exhibits includes some of the most significant works by members of the formidable Progressive Artists\u2019 Group and Raja Ravi Varma, among others. Power Punch Nadar paid a staggering Rs 61.80 crore for Amrita Sher-Gil\u2019s The Story Teller in September 2023. A competitive bidder at auctions, she owns some of the most expensive works of Indian art, including SH Raza\u2019s Saurashtra and FN Souza\u2019s Birth. What Next Designed by Ghanaian-British architect David Adjaye, KNMA will be India\u2019s largest art and culture centre in 2026. It is being built on a 1,00,000 sqm site in Delhi. This year, KNMA will present an immersive exhibition of MF Husain alongside some of his works, coinciding with the Venice Biennale.

The Chennai Super Kings (CSK) skipper is rated among the most influential captains to ever play the game. Last year, he guided CSK to a record-equalling fifth IPL title. Regardless of geography, Dhoni is still among Indian cricket\u2019s biggest draws. Power Punch WhileIPL teamscontinue to experiment with different captains, CSK\u2019s faith in Dhoni is unwavering. In Chennai, Dhoni has a free hand and a veto in every team decision. Even if 2024 turns out to be his farewell season, Dhoni is expected to be seen in the CSK dug-out for years to come. Be it Virat Kohli or any cricketer playing his first season, many players look up to him and seek his counsel. He remains the most sought-after brand, especially for those marketing trust and reliability. Once Dhoni calls time, he is expected to get a bigger role in Indian cricket. What Next The summer of 2024 could possibly be his last. A win in Dhoni\u2019s final season would see another fairytale ending for the man who got India the 2011 World Cup by hitting a six.

Chandrasekhar, who is also MoS for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship, now holds the additional responsibility of the Jal Shakti Ministry. Power Punch Seen as accessible, he has been a vital link between the government and industry. Apart from playing a significant role in shaping of incentives for semiconductor manufacturing in India, Chandrasekhar has rolled out schemes to facilitate smaller start-ups in designing chips in the country. He also led the framing of rules for the online gaming sector. What Next The next step for him is to draft the Digital India Bill which promises to significantly change the Internet ecosystem in India and impact big digital businesses.

Power Punch Bansal played a key role in scripting the BJP\u2019s victory in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections in 2017. As the then UP BJP general secretary (organisation), he was credited with adding 1,000 additional office-bearers from the booth to state levels from among the OBCs and Dalits, strengthening the booth committees, and focusing on the panchayat polls to energise the party ahead of the Assembly polls. Bansal had also contributed to the party\u2019s successful campaign in UP in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. What Next As the BJP in-charge of three crucial states, Bansal has his task cut out in the run-up to the Lok Sabha polls. While Odisha, ruled by the BJD, is headed for simultaneous Assembly elections, Bansal\u2019s organisational mandate is to give a boost to the BJP\u2019s prospects in Bengal, where the ruling TMC has continued to pose a formidable challenge to the party. This apart, the BJP leadership may also ask the seasoned organisational man to shoulder other key responsibility in the coming days. Social media quotientX: @sunilbansalbjp 1.2M followers 61)Pushkar Singh Dhami, 48Chief Minister, Uttarakhand Why Despite assumptions that he was appointed as Chief Minister only because he is seen as a young face and has a clean image, Pushkar Singh Dhami has demonstrated the ability to take difficult decisions and uphold his promises. His success in delivering on commitments such as the Uniform Civil Code (UCC), his prompt handling of the violence in Haldwani and his active involvement in the Silkyara Bend\u2013Barkot tunnel rescue operations have solidified this perception. Power Punch Dhami has been credited for the passage of the UCC in the state, with the legislation likely to serve as a model for other states and potentially for the Central government. Dhami\u2019s leadership on this issue has garnered him significant political capital. What Next The task of winning all five Lok Sabha seats in Uttarakhand will rest on Dhami\u2019s shoulders. As Chief Minister, he faces the challenge of striking a balance between ecological preservation and development initiatives in the state vulnerable to natural disasters. Social media quotientX: @pushkardhami 488.3K followers 62)Priyanka GandhiVadra, 52Congress general secretary Why She is a key presence at the Congress\u2019s decision-making high table. Priyanka, who first took on a political role in UP, continues to call the shots in the state \u2014 despite remaining away since the party fared abysmally in the 2022 Assembly elections. Power Punch Her hand was seen in the surprise decision to replace Brijlal Khabri as Uttar Pradesh chief last August, just 10 months into the post. Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge was reportedly not keen to change Khabri but he had little option. She also worked the phones to seal seat-sharing with SP\u2019sAkhilesh Yadavearlier this month. What Next All eyes are on whether Priyanka will make her electoral debut in the 2024 elections. The stage is set, with Sonia Gandhi shifting to the Rajya Sabha, vacating her seat of Raebareli, a traditional Congress and Gandhi family stronghold. Another option could be Amethi, represented by Rahul in 2004, 2009 and 2014, before his defeat in 2019 to senior BJP leader Smriti Irani. Social media quotientX: @priyankagandhi 5.6 M followers 63) Rajiv Kumar, 64Chief Election Commissioner Why Having been CEC since May 2022, he has overseen the preparations for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections and will helm the ECI as it carries out the mammoth exercise involving nearly 97 crore voters. In his tenure so far, Kumar has focused on cleaning up finances of registered unrecognised political parties, improving the level of political discourse during elections by issuing several advisories to parties and pushing back on claims of EVM faults. Power Punch With CECs and ECs, current and former, facing legal challenges to decisions taken while in office, the current ECI under Kumar flagged the concerns to the Union Law Ministry. This led the government to put a protection against litigation for decisions of the ECI in the recently passed CEC and Other ECs (Appointment, Conditions of Service and Term of Office) Act, 2023. What Next After the Supreme Court verdict on the electoral bonds scheme, Kumar said the poll panel will act by its directives. As the gloves come off in the bitter run-up to the polls, how the EC handles complaints will be carefully watched. Social media quotientX: @rajivkumarec 26.4K followers 64)Bhagwant Mann, 50Chief Minister, Punjab Why Bhagwant Mann is seen as one of the most powerful Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leaders. He heads a strategically important border state while handling issues related to farmers\u2019 unrest, drug menace and law and order. Power Punch Mann has successfully dispelled the perception that the AAP leadership in Delhi controls Punjab. His growing profile was illustrated by the fact that he was picked by the Centre to lead the efforts to mediate between farm unions in the ongoing dispute between them. On Republic Day, during the at-home event hosted by Governor Banwarilal Purohit, the Punjab CM grabbed eyeballs when he sang the famous Punjabi number Chhalla. What Next Mann\u2019s challenge is to ensure the party\u2019s victory in the Lok Sabha elections. The AAP, which has 92 MLAs in the 117-member Assembly, won only theJalandharLok Sabha seat last time. This year will be a momentous one for the Punjab CM on the personal front too. As he announced in his Republic Day speech, he is set to become a father again,in March. Social media quotientX: @BhagwantMann 1.5M followers 65) General Anil Chauhan, 62Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) Why Gen Anil Chauhan, as India\u2019s second CDS, has been discreetly driving a series of military reforms, at the top of which is the creation of theatre commands. He has also been instrumental in prioritising defence procurements from the defence budget available. Prior to taking over as the CDS, he served as the military advisor in the National Security Council Secretariat (NSCS). In his 40-year career, he has held several command and staff appointments, besides earning extensive experience in counterinsurgency operations in J&K and the Northeast. Power Punch Gen Chauhan was chosen as the CDS by the government almost a year after his predecessor GenBipin Rawatdied in a helicopter crash. A quiet worker who prefers staying away from the spotlight, he has often been referred to as a consensus man \u2014 taking everybody on board before arriving at a critical decision. What Next He is learnt to be working towards unity among the three services. Actively involved in the radicalAgnipathscheme that was brought for military recruitment in 2022, he will be involved in all changes related to the scheme. SOCIAL MEDIA QUOTIENTNot on social media 66) TV Somanathan, 58Finance and Expenditure Secretary Why As Finance and Expenditure Secretary, TV Somanathan is the go-to person for the government for its fiscal mathematics. He has been the brain behind the government\u2019s Budget, which has been appreciated for displaying fiscal prudence and not offering pre-election sops. He believes it is an error that many economies have made \u2014 to inject a stimulus when it is necessary and not withdraw it when it is no longer needed. Power Punch Despite apprehensions of a lower nominal GDP affecting the fiscal math, Somanathan was able to keep the fiscal deficit at 5.8 per cent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as against 5.9 per cent budgeted earlier for FY24 and now aims to restrict it to below 4.5 per cent by 2025-26. What Next Somanathan will have to meet the economy\u2019s growth objectives amid continuing risk from rural distress, lack of productive jobs and high inflation. On growth and global vulnerabilities, Somanathan believes that a real GDP growth of 6.5 per cent is not low. On international ratings for India, that have not been upgraded for a long time, he is confident that will change soon if India continues to be fiscally prudent. SOCIAL MEDIA QUOTIENTNot on social media 67) CR Paatil, 68Gujarat BJP President and Lok Sabha MP Why A close aide of PM Modi, CR Paatil, despite his Maharashtra roots, has a strong presence in Gujarat. In 2023 there was speculation about Paatil being replaced as the Gujarat BJP chief after he completed three years in office but the party decided not to take any chances and retained him to lead the state into the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. Power Punch During the coup against the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in Maharashtra in 2022, the rival\u00a0faction led by Eknath Shinde camped at a resort in Surat, under tight security \u2014 an arrangement said to have been choreographed by Paatil. Such is the clout of the former policeman that those in the party involved in alleged smear campaigns against Paatil are facing investigation by the Surat Crime Branch. Under his leadership, several Congress leaders have not only moved to the BJP but have also been given ministerial berths. What Next After the BJP won all 26 Lok Sabha seats in the state in 2014 and 2019, as he prepares for a third term, PM Modi has put his trust in Paatil again to get a hat-trick from Gujarat. Paatil has set a target for a victory margin of five lakh votes for each candidate. He could also be given a bigger role in national politics. SOCIAL MEDIA QUOTIENTX: @CRPaatil 509.2K followers 68)Rohit Sharma, 36India cricket captain Why Captain across formats, Rohit Sharma has played the perfect big brother to the young Indian side. Opening the batting, the 36-year-old led the way during the World Cup. Though India finished runners-up, Rohit\u2019s team got applauded globally for playing an exciting brand of cricket. An influential cricketer, he has an army of social media followers and endorses several brands. Power Punch Rohit enjoys the confidence of the BCCI and has a major say in most selection decisions. Be it the call of phasing out seniors for Tests or the sidelining of those preferring IPL over domestic cricket, the Indian captain has been behind these important decisions. Though he lost the franchise captaincy to Hardik Pandya late last year, his sparkling leadership record in IPL makes him a strong voice in theMumbai Indiansdressing room. In a clear signal that his aura has far from faded, the BCCI named him the World T20 captain of a team that will have Pandya. What Next Having lost the World Test Championship and 50-over World Cup final, Rohit has another shot at glory at the T20 World Cup. An ICC event title would enhance his leadership legacy.

A full-time SEBI member till October 4, 2021, she handled many departments, including market regulation, and market intermediaries regulation and supervision. Power Punch Buch has spearheaded many initiatives, including the Application Supported by Blocked Amount (ASBA)-like structure for secondary market, share buyback norms, advertisement code for investment advisers, additional disclosure norms for certain foreign portfolio investors and norms to check financial influencers. She oversaw the transition of the trade settlement cycle in the secondary market to T+1 (trade plus one day).

It is working on delisting regulations for companies. SOCIAL MEDIA QUOTIENTNot on social media 70) Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, 56Minister of Jal Shakti  Why Through his Jal Shakti Ministry, Gajendra Singh Shekhawat steers three key projects of the Narendra Modi-led government: Jal Jeevan Mission (to provide clean drinking water); Namami Gange (to preserve the Ganga); and the inter-linking of rivers, apart from being a key Rajasthan leader. The BJP is looking to highlight the Jal Jeevan Mission, which aims to provide tap water to every rural household by 2024, in its campaign for the upcoming general elections. Power Punch Shekhawat has played a decisive role in resolving key inter-state river linking disputes, be it the Ken-Betwa project between Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh or the Modified Parbati-Kalisindh-Chambal-ERCP link project between Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. A two-time Lok Sabha MP, he is also important to the party organisationally. He plays a significant role in discussions with allies and those interested in joining the party.

Under his leadership, Gujarat saw the opening of the first offshore campus of two Australian Universities and hosted the 10th edition of the Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit (VGGS). In the nearly two-and-a-half years of his chief ministership, Patel remains a non-controversial figure. He is likely to be a key leader when Gujarat bids for hosting the Olympics in 2036, and launches India\u2019s first Bullet Train between Ahmedabad and Mumbai in 2026. Power Punch Under Patel, the Gujarat government has made many bold moves like relaxing the prohibition law to open wine-and-dine facilities in the GIFT City area to boost business and empower companies to issue drinking licences. What Next The Lok Sabha elections of 2024 will be the next challenge for CM Patel. The party is eyeing a hattrick of winning all the 26 seats in Gujarat after registering a clean sweep in 2014 and 2019, with a higher vote margin. Patel\u2019s performance as CM of Gujarat will play a key role in it. Social media quotientX: @Bhupendrapbjp 581.9K followers 72) DK Shivakumar, 59Deputy Chief minister, Karnataka; state Congress chief Why The thumping victory that the Congress party registered in the 2023 Karnataka Assembly polls, winning 135 seats out of 224, is widely attributed to the organisational capabilities of DK Shivakumar. He was seen to have brought a freshness to the Congress thinking for the polls. Power Punch The appointment of the chief minister of Karnataka was delayed for several days after the Congress registered a big win in the 2023 Assembly polls on account of a strong push by Shivakumar to be made CM. The Congress resisted the push but conceded to Shivakumar\u2019s demand to be the lone Deputy CM in the government \u2014 seen as setting the stage for him to be the next CM. What Next Shivakumar is expected to make another strong push to be made the CM when the Congress government under Siddaramaiah completes half its five-year term. The Deputy CM is banking on the Congress facilitating a mid-term change of guard as reportedly agreed within the party at the time of government formation in May 2023. Social media quotientX: @DKShivakumar 614.4K followers 73) Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, 35Leader of Opposition in Bihar; RJD leader Why Though out of power after yet another switch by Nitish Kumar, Tejashwi looks like a much-assured leader now and is well and truly out of his father Lalu Prasad\u2019s shadow. His speech in the Assembly during the recent trust vote, in which he targeted Nitish without being overtly aggressive, won him praise and illustrated the distance he has travelled. Power Punch Tejashwi\u2019s strength continues to be his mass base, particularly the Muslim-Yadav combine that he has inherited from his father and which constitutes about 31 per cent of the state population. But Tejashwi has added economic justice to the party\u2019s social justice slogan and claimed credit for the previous Mahagathbandhan government\u2019s focus on jobs. What Next Tejashwi\u2019s immediate goal will be to build on the RJD\u2019s gains and win as many Lok Sabha seats as possible in the coming elections. But the crucial test for him will be the next Bihar state elections. One thing that will keep him, and his family, worried is the land-for-jobs case in which they are accused of corruption and are under the legal scanner. Social media quotientX: @yadavtejashwi 5M followers 74)Bhajan Lal Sharma, 57Chief Minister, Rajasthan Why As Chief Minister of the largest state, Bhajan Lal Sharma has been tasked with enforcing the Modi-Shah mandate. While other BJP leaders in Rajasthan are a force unto themselves \u2014 and perhaps that\u2019s what ruled them out of the top post in the state \u2014 Sharma has the backing of the party\u2019s top leadership and is a medium to implementtheir will. Power Punch Sharma being named the CM in December 2023 ended the 25-year tradition where Rajasthan saw the Chief Minister chair rotate betweenAshok Gehlotand Vasundhara Raje. He overtook party leaders such as Raje,Rajendra Rathore,Satish Poonia, and even Central leaders for the top spot. To break this cycle that had hardened power structures in the state was also an imperative behind his appointment. What Next The party manifesto has been adopted as a policy document. As the party goes into polls, his government would seek to tick as many boxes as possible before itseeks votes. Social media quotientX: @BhajanlalBjp 248.9K followers 75) Akhilesh Yadav, 50President,Samajwadi Party  Why Of all the leaders in the INDIA alliance of Opposition parties, Akhilesh, perhaps, has the most crucial role to play. How the bloc does will depend to a large extent on the performance of the SP and the Congress in Uttar Pradesh, with a total of 80 seats, where they have sealed a seat-sharing deal. Power Punch Akhilesh is the most prominent Opposition leader in Uttar Pradesh at present, with the Mayawati-led BSP reduced to the margins after winning just one seat in the 2022 Assembly polls and the Congress not having a prominent face in the state. With his \u201cPDA (Pichhda, Dalit, Alpasankhyak)\u201d pitch and demand for a caste census, Akhilesh could help the Opposition regain some ground by challenging the BJP\u2019s OBC support base. What Next He may have sealed a seat-sharing deal with the Congress but carrying out his party\u2019s Lok Sabha poll campaign and ensuring coordination with the Congress on the ground will be the next big challenge for the SP leader. Social media quotientX: @yadavakhilesh 19.2M followers 76) Ajit Pawar, 64Deputy chief minister, Maharashtra, and President,Nationalist Congress Party Why Long in his uncle Sharad Pawar\u2019s shadow, Ajit took the plunge and split the NCP last July. Joining hands with theBharatiya Janata Party(BJP), he not only managed to bring the majority of the legislators to his side but has also won the party name and election symbol. He is now the Deputy CM of Maharashtra, with most of the NCP senior leadership with him, and the Election Commission\u2019s seal that he leads the \u201creal\u201d NCP. Power Punch By getting Praful Patel elected to the Rajya Sabha, Ajit Pawar proved his mettle. He showed his ability to strategise and spring surprises, which had thus far been his uncle\u2019s domain. Right after the split in the NCP, in the first test in the battle of the Pawars, Ajit managed to bag 400 gram panchayats of the 2,359 local governing bodies, coming second to the BJP that won 700 panchayats. What Next The coming Lok Sabha polls will be Ajit\u2019s first without his uncle and he is hoping to consolidate his party\u2019s presence. But the real battle will be in Baramati, a Pawar family bastion, where his party might have to take on his cousinSupriya Sule.

His appeal within the tribal community helped the party in its succesful bid to reverse its losses from five years earlier and propel it to victory. Sai comes from the tribal-dominatedSurgujaregion where the BJP won all the 14 Assembly seats, like the Congress had done in 2018. Power Punch Sai enjoys the confidence of the top BJP leadership. At an election rally, Union Home Minister Amit Shah appealed to people to vote for him, saying he would be \u201cmade a big man\u201d if he won. The Sai government has so far made budgetary allocations to fulfil \u201cModi guarantees\u201d such as building houses for the poor and higher MSP for rice farmers, and announced investigations into alleged corruption during the Congress rule. Under his government, security forces have also stepped up anti-Naxal operations. What Next The litmus test for Sai will be ensuring that all \u201cModi guarantees\u201d are fulfilled and the BJP wins a sizeable number of Lok Sabha seats in the state with a higher vote share than last time. Despite being trounced in the 2018 Assembly polls, the BJP rode the Narendra Modi wave to win nine of the 11 parliamentary seats in 2019.

He has increased the footprint of his party AIMIM in other states, notching up wins in Assembly and local body elections. He is a supporter of reservation for backward Muslims in government jobs and educational institutions and a vocal proponent of abolition of the Haj subsidy advocating for its use to educate Muslim women. Power Punch Owaisi has been taking on the BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Under his leadership, the AIMIM has forayed into states such as Maharashtra, Gujarat and Karnataka. What Next The AIMIM is \u201cin alliance\u201d with the Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) in Telangana and with the Congress in power in the state. Owaisi needs to build bridges with the grand old party to ensure his MLAs are heard in the Assembly. How he relates to the non-BJP parties could also shape minority politics in the face of a dominant BJP. Social media quotientX: @asadowaisi 2.9M followers 79) Alia Bhatt, 30Actor, producer, entrepreneur Why One of the most versatile stars of Bollywood, who has travelled the whole arc of character-driven roles, Alia Bhatt showed that she can return to breezy and commercial roles, like she did in Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahani (2023), with equal elan. Now a producer herself, she made her international debut with the Netflix spy-thriller Heart of Stone last year. She also became the first Indian to be Gucci\u2019s global ambassador, attending the brand\u2019s fashion shows in Seoul and Milan. Power Punch As of October 2023, she is the one of the most-followed Indian actors on Instagram. She received the National Award for Best Actress for her powerful performance as the titular protagonist ofGangubai Kathiawadi. She also won popular awards for Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahani. Reliance Retail acquired a majority stake of 51 per cent in Ed-a-Mamma, her brand for new mothers. She has been picked by filmmaker Sanjay Leela Bhansali again for a new venture. What Next While Love & War is going to be a Christmas 2025 release and its demanding shooting schedule is going to keep her busy this year, Bhatt will be seen on the big screen with Dharma Production\u2019s Jigra in September. Social media quotientInstagram: @aliaabhatt 83 M followers 80) Harish Salve, 68Former Solicitor General of India Why Harish Salve may have shifted his operations to London almost a decade ago, but he is still dialled in on high-stakes legal issues by the Modi government \u2014 from representingKulbhushan Jadhavbefore the ICJ to defending the abrogation of Article 370 before the Supreme Court. From Mukesh Ambani, Ratan Tata to Prime Minister Modi, Salve has an enviable clientele for whom he sometimes flies back to Delhi. Power punch Following the Hindenburg Research\u2019s report on short selling, it was to Salve that Adani turned, to defend him publicly. Salve spoke up for his former client, calling for a probe against the research team. What next In September last year, Salve was appointed as part of the eight-member high-level panel to examine the issue of holding simultaneous elections in the country. The former Solicitor General of India, Salve is attending the meetings of the committee virtually. The report is expected later this year. Social media quotientNot on social media 81) General Manoj Pande, 61Chief of Army Staff Why He is the first Army chief from the Corps of Engineers. The decorated officer has nearly four decades of experience in the Army during which he has served along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) facing China and the Line of Control (LOC) opposite Pakistan. He has also served as the Commander-in-Chief of the tri-service Andaman & Nicobar Command (CINCAN). Power Punch He has been at the forefront of major transformations in the military. The significant planned military reform on creation of integrated theatre commands, transforming the force in line with modern warfare trends, a focus on China without losing sight of terrorism in J&K, recruitment of soldiers under the Agnipath scheme\u2014Gen Pande has been overseeing all. What Next He has multiple critical tasks, especially in driving self-reliance, innovation and induction of technology in the Army for modernising the force, before he retires later this year. Social media quotientNot on social media 82)Manohar Lal Khattar, 69Chief Minister, Haryana Why A surprise non-Jat choice for Haryana Chief Minister, Khattar has since gone from strength to strength and, after two terms in the post, is the BJP\u2019s foremost leader in the state now. He has also managed to run a stable government despite the BJP having to lean on ally Jannayak Janata Party (JJP) for a majority. Power Punch Farmer leaders may be slamming his government\u2019s high-handed measures, but in ensuring that the protesting farmers don\u2019t get to reach Delhi \u2014 where a situation like the year-long agitation held by them in 2020-21 could develop \u2014 Khattar has managed to do what the Centre expected of him. What remains to be seen is how he contains the backlash from farmers on the Haryana side. What Next The upcoming Haryana Assembly elections will be foremost on Khattar\u2019s mind, given the anti-incumbency after 10 years in power and given that last time he needed the help of the JJP to form the government. While the Congress is a divided house, it cannot be written off as a determined Bhupender Singh Hooda leads the fightback. Social media quotientX: @mlkhattar 2.3M followers 83) S Somanath, 60Chairman,ISRO   Why As chairman, he is charting a new path for the Indian Space Research Organisation. ISRO is not just doing its own missions, it is also getting into powerful space alliances that make it an extremely important global player. Somanath has thus emerged as the most influential head of the space agency since K Kasturirangan. Power Punch The moon landing moment, undoubtedly. The successful landing ofChandrayaan-3 captured the imagination of the entire nation. Just like the implications of the nuclear tests, for instance, went far beyond nuclear or military affairs, the ramifications of Chandrayaan-3\u2019s success have added another dimension to India\u2019s increasing global heft, across sectors. There have been several other important successes after that, including the launch of the Aditya-L1 mission. What Next Somanath has another one year in office, at least. During this time, several important space missions are planned that could buttress ISRO\u2019s emergence as a major player in space exploration. Among them are the launch of NISAR, a first of its kind collaborative mission between ISRO and NASA, and the dress rehearsal flights of Gaganyaan, the human space mission. Social media QuotientNot on social media 84)Shashi Tharoor, 67Congress MP and author Why A suave and articulate politician, former UN diplomat Shashi Tharoor wears quite a few hats. The third-term Lok Sabha MP from Thiruvananthapuram has also made his own space within the Congress as a leader who speaks his mind, particularly on the values he believes in \u2014 both inside and, at times, outside party fora. His full embrace of his reputation as an English user with a love for obscure words is one of the reasons he is a darling of netizens. Recently, Tharoor was inducted into the Congress Working Committee, little over a year after he took on Mallikarjun Kharge for the Congress president\u2019s post. The unprecedented support Tharoor got made it difficult for the AICC establishment to continue ignoring him. Power Punch Even as the Congress prevaricated on the issue of inviting its top leaders for the Ram Temple inauguration, and the Hamas October 7 attack on Israel, Tharoor spoke his mind. What Next He recently hinted that 2024 could be his last election from the constituency, indicating he wanted to move to state politics. Social media quotientX: @ShashiTharoor 8.4M followers 85) Kumar Mangalam\u00a0Birla, 56Chairman, Aditya Birla Group Why Flagbearer of one of the country\u2019s oldest and most prestigious business houses, Birla oversees an industrial conglomerate with a turnover of $65 billion and operations in 40 countries across six continents. In 2023, he received the Padma Bhushan and was ranked as the ninth-richest Indian and 124th globally by Forbes. Power PunchThe Aditya Birla Group\u2019s footprint spans diverse sectors, including metals, pulp, fibre, chemicals, textiles, telecom and hospitality. Helming the group for nearly three decades, Birla has ensured that his revenue has grown well over 30 times in that time. What Next He is hoping to foray into branded jewellery and decorative paints. The push for further diversification comes at a time when the group has seemingly initiated a succession plan with Ananya and Aryaman, the older of Birla\u2019s three children, joining the boards of a few group companies. Birla is betting big on his decorative paints business, expecting it to become profitable with ?10,000 crore in three years of full-scale operations. Social media quotientNot on social media 86) Ramdev, 58Yoga guru, businessman Why The yoga guru-turned-entrepreneur behind Patanjali Ayurved, a leading consumer brand with a $7-billion market capitalisation, Ramdev is now venturing into the premium foods category to reach Rs 1 lakh crore revenue in five years. He co-founded Patanjali with Acharya Balkrishna, who has a net worth of $3.2 billion. Power Punch Ramdev was under fire in November last year when the Supreme Court imposed Rs 1 crore costs per false claim made by Patanjali. However, Patanjali\u2019s stock price has remained untouched, soaring 70 per cent in FY24. Incidentally, Patanjali Foods has prepared a vision document for the next five years to become the largest player in the food-FMCG business, which includes an aggressive growth plan to reach Rs 5,000 crore operational profit and over Rs 50,000 crore turnover. What Next Ramdev\u2019s Patanjali Ayurved bid Rs 830 crore to acquire debt-ridden Rolta India, a defence-focused software company with significant real estate assets. Eyes will be on this as it marks a significant pivot from Patanjali\u2019s FMCG business. Social media quotientX: @yogrishiramdev 2.6M followers 87) Deepika Padukone, 38Actor Why Having proved her acting chops and having won several accolades, Deepika Padukone has established herself as a bonafide action star with feisty characters in Pathaan (2023), Jawan (2023) and Fighter (2024), all of which generated several hundred crores for the industry and overturned the definition of an action hero, so far a male preserve. The actor-producer, who founded LiveLoveLaugh Foundation that works on creating awareness about mental health, is also known as a successful entrepreneur and a brand ambassador for global luxury brands. Power Punch Padukone was part of an elite group of presenters at the BAFTA (British Academy of Film and Television Arts), which included footballer David Beckham, actor Cate Blanchett and singer Dua Lipa. In 2023, she presented the Oscar for Best Song to Naatu Naatu from the film RRR. What Next Padukone will play the woman pivot inKalki2898 AD, a sci-fiction directed by Nag Ashwin. She will join Rohit Shetty\u2019s \u201ccop universe\u201d with Singham Again as a feisty police woman. Social media quotientInstagram: @deepikapadukone 78.6M followers 88) Sunil Bharti Mittal, 66Chairperson, Bharati Enterprises Why Even though the entry of Reliance Jio spelled trouble for a number of telecom companies, under Sunil Bharti Mittal\u2019s leadership, Bharti Airtel emerged from the consolidation largely unscathed. Airtel has been a key player in rolling out 5G infrastructure in India, alongside Reliance Jio, making the rollout of the communication tech fastest in the country compared to anywhere in the world. Airtel\u2019s well-considered strategy of carrying the low-cost, high-volume Minutes Factory in Africa has made it as familiar a brand in nearly half of Africa as in India. Power Punch Airtel-backed OneWeb scored a symbolic victory over rival Jio\u2019s satellite communication with its pitch to allocate spectrum, eventually getting the government\u2019s approval. What Next Airtel will have to stop unlimited 5G plans at some point in 2024 and begin monetisation of the technology for which it has paid top dollar in the spectrum auction. Getting the pricing right will be crucial for 5G to make business sense at a consumer level for the company. Social media quotientNot on social media 89) Praful Khoda Patel, 66Administrator of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu, and Lakshadweep Why Frequent controversies \u2014 be it the ban on cow slaughter and sale, transport and storage of beef to the anti-social activities regulation \u2014 and the protests from the residents of Lakshadweep have not dented his authority. Patel is said to enjoy the confidence of PM Modi \u2014 in his brief stint as MLA, he was Minister of State for Home when Modi was the Gujarat CM \u2014 and continues to implement his projects in the archipelago, which is strategically important to India. Power Punch He ensured Modi\u2019s January visit to Lakshadweep was a huge success and an international event. The visit has also become a promotion for the tourism industry there. What Next Patel will have to see projects worth Rs 1,150 crore are efficiently implemented. With the Maldives now being inclined to China, the Union Territory\u2019s strategic importance has increased. An airport for defence purposes on the Minicoy Island, which is closest to the Maldives, is also on the cards and Patel is expected to be the man in charge to ensure this is rolled out. Social media quotientX: @prafulkpatel 44K followers 90)Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu, 59Chief Minister, Himachal Pradesh Why Seen as the common man\u2019s chief minister, Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu has managed to carve a niche for himself in the hill state where the Congress was earlier defined by old satraps from well-heeled families. Once a bus conductor, Sukhu has steered the state out of the economic crisis after the monsoon fury last year wiped out 400 lives and infrastructure worth Rs 12,000 crore. Sukhu contributed Rs 51 lakh to the disaster relief fund and has been very proactive in trying to get tourists back to the state. Power Punch The CM has been able to deftly manoeuvre the hurdles posed by MP Pratibha Singh, the wife of late five-time CM Virbhadra Singh and her son and minister Vikramaditya Singh. A few weeks back, he gave the latter a jolt when he pruned his portfolio only to add to it later. What Next He plans to give a big push to both agriculture and industry in the state with policy changes such as tax concessions to milk producers. In the pipeline is a comprehensive sports policy offering financial incentives to athletes who win medals internationally. Social media quotientX: @SukhuSukhvinder 65.8K followers 91)Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, 67Leader of the Indian National Congress in Lok Sabha Why As the leader of the much depleted Congress side in Lok Sabha, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury has often punched above his party\u2019s weight in the House. The aggression even earned him a suspension. Prime Minister Narendra Modi too makes it a point to respond to Chowdhury\u2019s barbs in the House. He is the Opposition\u2019s voice in Prime Minister-headed high-power committees which pick the CBI Director, Central Vigilance Commissioner, Chief Information Commissioner, Chairman and members of the NHRC and the Lokpal. Power Punch Despite Mamata Banerjee\u2019s Trinamool Congress being a part of the INDIA bloc and the Congress central leadership signaling that there could be seat adjustments with her party,\u00a0 Chowdhury\u2014 a fighter with a grassroots connect \u2014 made it clear that an alliance would be possible only if the Congress got a respectable number of seats. What Next For the Lok Sabha elections, he hopes to stitch an alliance with the Left and not only retain the two seats the Congress has in West Bengal but also better its performance. Social media quotientX: @adhirrcinc 80K followers 92) Prashant Bhushan, 67Public interest lawyer Why From high stakes corruption battles, judicial accountability to public issues that resonate across the country, for over two decades, Prashant Bhushan has doggedly pursued his causes before the Supreme Court. When spaces for pushback are shrinking, Bhushan has used Public Interest Litigation (PIL) as an effective check and balance. Winning some and losing several, he continues to challenge successive governments. Power Punch Bhushan\u2019s persistence in the case challenging the electoral bonds scheme saw the SC deliver a body blow to the government\u2019s ambitious law. This was one of the biggest setbacks to the Modi government since it came to power in 2014. During the pandemic, Bhushan\u2019s cases included the challenge against vaccine mandates and protection of migrant workers. What Next Besides contesting the procedure of selection of the Chief Election Commissioner by the Centre, another cause Bhushan has taken up is against GM crops. The case is yet to be taken up in court. Social media quotientX: @pbhushan1 2.4M followers 93) Hemant Soren, 47Former Chief Minister, Jharkhand Why Former CM Hemant Soren is at the centre of the political turmoil in Jharkhand, which is among the handful of Opposition-ruled states. He has faced one controversy after another, from the yet-to-be-publicised Election Commission inquiry into his ownership of a mining lease to his \u201cdisappearance\u201d a day before the ED raided his Delhi residence only to reappear in Ranchi ahead of a crucial transition of power. He is now in prison. Power Punch Anticipating his arrest by the ED, which had summoned him 10 times by late January, Soren personally tendered his resignation as CM at the Raj Bhavan to ensure a smooth transition of power to new CM Champai Soren and outmanoeuvre any attempt to impose President\u2019s Rule. Hemant used his opportunity to address the Assembly during the ensuing floor test to target the BJP, calling it \u201canti-Adivasi\u201d and setting the tone for the LS elections. What Next The biggest challenge for Soren is emerging from the corruption shadow, with the ED also investigating other cases in which his name has come up. Social media quotientX: @HemantSorenJMM 1M followers 94) Sharad Pawar, 83President, Nationalist Congress Party (Sharadchandra Pawar) Why Even after six decades in politics, Pawar continues to be a crucial behind-the-scenes strategist and mover of Maharashtra and national politics. He is currently facing one of his biggest challenges yet, with nephew Ajit Pawar splitting the party and joining the BJP-Shiv Sena coalition. Just days after the Election Commission recognised Ajit Pawar\u2019s faction as the real NCP, it allotted a new symbol, that of a \u2018man blowing turha\u2019, to the Nationalist Congress Party-Sharadchandra Pawar. Power Punch Despite his diminished party, Pawar remains the guiding light and glue for the Opposition MVA in Maharashtra. A reputation of political stealth and a network of trustworthy comrades across all parties mean his opponents know they can\u2019t take him lightly. What NextAfter the split, which saw many senior leaders joining the Ajit camp, Pawar is looking at the challenge of giving the party a new identity and building confidence from the ground up. It is being speculated that daughter Supriya Sule may be named working president. Social media quotientX: @PawarSpeaks 2.8M followers ++++ 95) Uddhav Thackeray, 63President, Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray) Why Thackeray has suffered blow after blow in the last two years. There was the split of the Sena and the subsequent ruling of the Maharashtra Speaker that the Eknath Shinde-led Sena was the \u201cofficial\u201d party. Finding himself back at the drawing board and having to rebuild the party, Thackeray is still going strong, touring across the state to keep his voter base intact for the fight against the BJP-led NDA. And while he appears ready, there are questions whether the second rung leadership of the Shiv Sena, has the appetite for more battles with the BJP. And though not completely separated from its earlier communal avatar, his party seems to connect more to issues of social justice. Power Punch Despite being weak organisationally, Thackeray has, to an extent, succeeded in retaining sympathy after the split. How he manages to spin this needs to be seen. What Next Left with just 17 sitting MLAs and 6 MPs, Thackeray is facing a big challenge in the Lok Sabha polls and in the Assembly elections that will follow. Then there is the question of retaining the party cadre on the ground. Social media quotientX: @OfficeofUT 1.6M followers 96) Sadhguru, 66Founder, Isha Foundation  Why Apart from being an influential spiritual leader, Sadhguru has recently emerged as an advocate of social causes, the most recent ones focusing on climate activism and ecological preservation. He has lent momentum to the community movement for agro-forestry, planting saplings in farmlands to offset farmers\u2019 income. He has been at the forefront of tree plantation along the Cauvery although scientists say it isn\u2019t enough to hold the soil together. Therefore, he is now focused on recharging the soil by increasing its organic content. A Padma Vibhushan, he has been a key speaker at the UN World Headquarters, World Economic Forum as well as universities such as Oxford, Stanford and Harvard. Power Punch The Science-20 summit meeting of the G20 was held at Isha Yoga Centre, Coimbatore, where 100 delegates from across 20-member countries attended to discuss possibilities of clean energy. He has been able to draw international celebrities like Leonardo Di Caprio for his campaigns.

One who wears many hats, as director, writer, producer, talent-show judge and chat-show host, he ventured into advertising with Dharma 2.0, with the aim to create a boutique production house. Dharmatic Entertainment is dedicated to OTT content while Dharma Cornerstone Agency is grooming new talent. Power Punch Last year, Johar had a massive hit, winning critical appreciation for the rom-com Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahani, his seventh directorial feature after seven years. He also continued to create buzz with Koffee With Karan Season 8. What Next Dharma Productions is breaking out of mushy romance and pursuing other genres like theSidharth Malhotra-starrer hijack drama Yodha, Mr & Mrs Mahi, based on cricketerMahendra Singh Dhoni\u2019s life, with Rajkummar Rao and Janhvi Kapoor, and a prison break drama, Jigra, with Alia Bhatt.

Once called a \u201cone-man industry\u201d by French director Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, he continues to reinvent himself for every generation, either with character-driven roles or as a game show host, brand messenger and now a social media icon.

Vinesh was the first who accused the BJP MP of sexual harassment. The agitation was seen as a seminal moment in Indian sport, where power often lies with the administrators and not the players. Power Punch Multiple World Championship medallist Vinesh, along with Olympic medallists Bajrang Punia and Sakshi Malik, forced the government, which tried delaying things, to take action against the WFI chief. It was their three month-long sit-in at Jantar Mantar in Delhi that forced Brij Bhushan to \u2018retire\u2019 from the sport\u2019s administration even as the court continued to hear the case against him. Vinesh, the most vocal of the three, also returned her Khel Ratna and Arjuna award in protest after Sanjay Singh, a loyalist of Bhushan, was elected WFI president. What Next As she returns to action after spending the whole of 2023 away from the mat, first due to protests and then owing to an injury, Vinesh\u2019s challenge will be to get into the team for this summer\u2019s Paris Olympics. The 53kg Olympic weight category is the one she will aim for to make it to Paris.

The phrase \u201cAaya Ram, gaya Ram\u201d (Ram came, Ram went) is generally invoked to refer to politicians, particularly when they are seen as switching party allegiances back and forth in a short period. It has its origins in one extreme example of party-switching in Haryana, in the 1960s. Here\u2019s what happened. The Himachal Pradesh Speaker has disqualified the six Congress MLAs who cross-voted in the recently-concluded Rajya Sabha Polls in the state.With this, the six MLAs cease to be members of the Himachal Vishan Sabha, the speaker Kuldeep Pathania announced. \u201cThis order is subject to judicial scrutiny..it will attain finality after judicial scrutiny,\u201d Pathania said.\"The MLAs marked their attendence on both days, defied the whip twice by not being present during cut motions and financial bill/budget,\" Pathania said. Amid the political crisis, Himachal Pradesh Chief Minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu invited all his party MLAs to breakfast at his official residence, Oak Over, on Thursday.Over 20 MLAs, along with Deputy Chief Minister Mukesh Agnihotri, have arrived at the official residence. Sources indicate that party observers, including former Haryana Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda and Karnataka Deputy Chief Minister DK Shivkumar, will also engage with party MLAs today.Congress MLAs, speaking to the media before entering Oak Over, asserted that their government is stable, and there is no discussion about changing Chief Minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu. Meanwhile, the six rebel MLAs, who engaged in cross-voting during the Rajya Sabha MP election in favor of BJP candidate Harsh Mahajan, were reportedly not invited. Congress MLA Sanjay Awasthi stated, \"CM Sukhu invited all party MLAs.\"I believe the six MLAs who engaged in cross-voting have no place in the party. There is no question of inviting them.\" MLA Kuldeep Rathore remarked, \"Yesterday, the state budget was passed with a full majority. BJP should apologize to the people of Himachal Pradesh. The Sukhu government enjoys a full majority. Congress observers will interact with MLAs in closed-door sessions.\" Heavy police was deputed around the CM residence to maintain law and order situation. With the Congress central leadership scrambling to avert a crisis in Himachal Pradesh after an embarrassing defeat in the recently-concluded Rajya Sabha polls, Chief Minister Sukhvinder Singh Such has called all party MLAs for a breakfast meeting this morning in Shimla. The six Himachal Pradesh Congress MLAs, who cross-voted for BJP candidate Harsh Mahajan during the Rajya Sabha elections on Tuesday, were flown back to Panchkula after they appeared for hearing on a petition on anti-defection law before Speaker Kuldeep Singh Pathania. These MLAs, namely Rajinder Rana, Sudhir Sharma, Ravi Thakur, Inder Dutt lakhanpal, Chetanya Sharma and Divender Kumar (Bhutto), who had left for Panchkula after voting on Tuesday, had returned to Shimla on Wednesday morning and left before the central Congress observers reached Shimla. The six Congress MLAs along with three independents had reached Himachal Pradesh Assembly and were greeted with thumping and slogans by the BJP MLAs. Congress MLA Vikramaditya Singh told reporters that he won't be pressing his resignation for now. His resignation following Rajya Sabha poll results on Tuesday created panic among the Congress ranks in the state. Here is what he said: #WATCH| Shimla, Himachal Pradesh: Congress leader Vikramaditya Singh says, \"There is a difference between taking back the resignation and not pressing the resignation till the time the dialogue and the action of the observers is not complete... We have talked to the observers.\u2026pic.twitter.com/NFVn5ZaKuL  The BJP\u2019s Harsh Mahajan, 68, who pulled off a major upset to win the lone vacant Himachal Pradesh Rajya Sabha seat on Tuesday, defeating Congress heavyweight Abhishek Manu Singhvi, picked up the political ropes from his father Des Raj Mahajan, a former Vidhan Sabha Speaker and Congress minister. Having spent over four decades in the Congress, it was in September 2022 that Harsh Mahajan had joined the BJP. The Congress working president at the time said he was quitting, as the Congress had become \u201cvisionless, directionless and leaderless\u201d. Read the full story here  As the Congress faces a crisis in Himachal Pradesh after a humiliating defeat in the Rajya Sabha polls, party leader Navjot Singh Sidhu called for an assessment of the party's \"assets and liabilities\". The former Punjab unit president said the Rajya Sabha poll defeat was not just of the party candidate but had \"larger\" implications. The Himachal fiasco calls for an assessment of assets and liabilities for The Grand Old Party ??? \u2026. \u201cMasqueraders\u201d on plum posts covertly dancing to the tunes of agencies like CBI, ED and IT have spelt dooms day for us many a times !The loss is not@DrAMSinghviSahb\u2019s but\u2026  VIDEO | \"I am sad over the fact they (rebel MLAs) might be upset with me over a leading advocate like Abhishek Manu Singhvi, but not voting for candidates who should have been sent to Rajya Sabha from Himachal is betrayal with the party,\" says Himachal Pradesh CM Sukhwinder Singh\u2026pic.twitter.com/8M2zyf3x9a As the Sukhu government in Himachal Pradesh faces threat, Congress leader Sachin Pilot expressed hope that the party will resolve the political crisis in the hill state very soon. Pilot also targeted the BJP-led government at the Centre and said it failed in tackling rising inflation and unemployment. \"Our party has appointed observers in Himachal Pradesh...they will talk to everyone and hopefully the matter will be resolved very soon,\" he told reporters in Sikar.

Senior advocate Satya Pal Jain, who represented the six Congress MLAs before the Speaker, argued that they were only given the notice and the copy of the petition filed on Tuesday evening while other annexure were not supplied to them. Jain said according to rules, seven days' time has to be given to the MLAs for filing the reply the copy of the petition is supplied to them. Congress' Vikramaditya Singh, who resigned from the CM Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu-led cabinet, told ANI that he doesn't take pressure, but gives it. His statement came in response to queries on the lack of response on his resignation. #WATCH| Shimla, Himachal Pradesh: On asking why his resignation is not accepted, Congress leader Vikramaditya Singh says, \"It is the Chief Minister's prerogative... I do not take the pressure. I give pressure...\"pic.twitter.com/mlgkXPI2XC Before being adjourned sine die, Himachal Pradesh Vidhan Sabha passed the budget for 2024-25 and related Appropriation Bill authorising the government to spend Rs 6,24,21.73 crore from the consolidated fund. The Vidhan Sabha was adjourned a day ahead of schedule as political scenario changed dramatically after defeat of Congress candidate Abhishek Manu Singhvi in Rajya Sabha elections on Tuesday and announcement of resignation by Public works minister Vikramaditya Singh from Sukhu cabinet. The budget was presented on February 17, 2024 by Chief Minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu, who also holds the finance portfolio. Discussions on the budget were held for four days from February 19 to 22 Addressing reporters, Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said the BJP cannot take away the people's mandate in Himachal Pradesh through its \"Operation Lotus\". He added that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP chief J P Nadda were rejected by the voters of the hill state in the last assembly elections. The Congress has dispatched three senior observers -- Bhupesh Baghel, Bhupinder Singh Hooda and D K Shivakumar -- to Shimla.  The Himachal Pradesh Assembly session was adjourned sine die after the budget was passed by voice vote, even as not a single BJP member remained in attendance. As six Congress MLAs, who cross-voted in the Rajya Sabha polls on Tuesday went missing, only to return to Shimla the next day from an 'undisclosed location', the scenario in Himachal Pradesh is the third instance of political uncertainty within just two months of 2024. Earlier in February, the ruling Mahagathbandhan or the grand alliance effectively ended in Bihar, as CM Nitish Kumar ended ties with Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav\u2019s Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and the Congress. Kumar then secured an alliance with the BJP, resigned from his post, and the new alliance won the trust vote in the state Assembly. Questions on the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha government's future arose as then CM Hemant Soren submitted his resignation moments before his arrest by the Enforcement Directorate in a land scam case. JMM leader and Hemant Soren loyalist Champai Soren won the trust vote in the Jharkhand Assembly. Party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra alleged that the BJP wants to \"crush\" people's mandate by misusing money power and probe agencies. \"The people of Himachal used this right (to vote) and formed the Congress government with a clear majority. But the BJP wants to crush this right of the people of Himachal by misusing the money power, power of agencies and its power of the Centre,\" Priyanka Gandhi said in a post in Hindi on X. ???????? ??? ?? ???? ?? ???? ???? ?? ????? ????? ?? ?????? ??? ?????? ?? ???? ?? ???? ??? ?????? ?? ???????? ???? ?? ?????? ????? ?? ???????? ?? ????? ????? ????? ????? ????, ????????? ?? ???? ?? ?????? ?? ????? ?? ???????? ???? ?????? ??????? ?? ?? ?????? ?? ?????? ????? ??? ??\u2026 The Himachal Pradesh budget was passed in the Assembly on Wednesday as the BJP MLAs staged a walkout over the suspension of their fellow legislators. The Congress government has been fighting for its survival since its shock defeat in the Rajya Sabha polls yesterday After suspension of 15 BJP MLAs, the remaining 10 legislators of the party staged a walkout from the Assembly in protest. Addressing reporters, BJP MLA Satpal Satti said, \u201cThere is no doubt that the Budget will get passed, but [Congress] government will not survive.\u201d He claimed that had there been voting, at least 15 MLAs would have voted against the Budget. On if Vikramaditya Singh was in touch with the BJP, Satti said, \u201cThe government did not provide land to put up the statue of Virbhadra Singh at Mall Road. They disrespected him. Had it been our (BJP) government, we would have allotted the land in the first month itself. Now, it is for Vikramadityaji to take a call where he has to go.\u201d Speaking to reporters, Himachal Pradesh CM Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu asserted that no one has asked for his resignation, nor has he offered to quit.\"We will prove the majority. We will win, the people of Himachal will win,\" he said. Addressing a press conference on Wednesday, Congress leader Jairam Ramesh asserted that the party's priority was to save its government in Himachal Pradesh.\"Right now, our priority is to save our Congress government because the Congress party had received a clear mandate in December 2022. The people of Himachal Pradesh had rejected the PM, Jagat Prakash Nadda, Anurag Thakur, and Jairam Thakur. The mandate was for the Congress party. So, this mandate should be respecte,\" he said.\"The Modi government has just one guarantee -- topple all Congress Governments. We will not let this happen,\" he added.The party has also asked the oberservers to speak to all MLAs in the state and prepare a comprehensive report on the crisis. After reports that Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu has offered to quit, the Himachal Chief Minister said, \u201cI haven\u2019t offered any resignation. I am a warrior, will keep fighting.\u201d He asserted that the Congress party will remain in power in the state for five years.The Congress Legislative Party is set to meet this evening.

Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut hit out at the BJP, saying that they use money and central agencies to topple governments.\"What else can BJP do? BJP through money, power, and agencies can do this only. They can topple governments and buy MLAs. This happened in both Himachal and Uttar Pradesh,\" Raut said.

Haryana BJP keep away, hope anger doesn\u2019t reach it", "content": "The BJP got a reprieve on the farmer front the past few days, with the protestershaving called a pause. However, with no end to the agitation in sight yet as the farmers meet again Thursday, the party may find it harder to continue riding two boats, as it has been doing \u2013 in Punjab, supporting the farmers; and in Haryana, defending its government\u2019s crackdown against them. Thedeath of a youth, Shubhkaran Singh, of injuries received at a protest site, and thealleged assault on another, Preetpal Singh, in the same incident have mounted pressure on the HaryanaBJPto come out on the side of farmers. Thememory of the 2020-21 agitationover three Central agricultural laws is still fresh in the minds of Haryana BJP leaders. The agitating farmers had ensured that the ruling alliance leaders could not enter their native Haryana villages at many places at the time. The party does not want a repeat ahead of the Lok Sabha polls and Haryana Assembly elections later this year. The tide started turning after Punjab BJP leaders, particularly those who have come to the party from the Congress and were very vocal in support of farmers during the 2020-21 agitation, started breaking their silence. If Punjab BJP chief Sunil Jakhar called himself \u201ca farmer first\u201d, former Congress CM and now BJP leader Amarinder Singh met Prime MinisterNarendra Modito raise their concerns. Jakhar also urged restraint on the part of \u201cgovernments and security forces\u201d after Shubhkaran\u2019s death, in a swipe at Haryana\u2019s highhanded actions, while Amarinder slammed the alleged assault leaving Preetpal injured as \u201cbarbaric\u201d. So far, the Haryana BJP has been blaming theAam Aadmi Party-led Punjab government for the flaring up of the protests, hoping the charges will stick. On February 21, Haryana BJP president Nayab Singh Saini accused the AAP government of doing politics on farmers\u2019 woes, even as he expressed condolences over Shubhkaran\u2019s death. \u201cPunjab CMBhagwant Mannshould reveal how many crops his government has announcedMSPon. In Haryana, our government already has MSP for 14 crops. We believe in performance,\u201d Saini said. He earlier urged farmers to come forward for talks, saying an agitation was not the way. The Haryana government has also been claiming that the farmer protests on its side are confined to only select pockets. However, it is finding it harder to explain the case of Preetpal, a resident of Sangrur district, who was reportedly injured while serving langar to protesters at the Khanauri site. The farmer unions claimed that the Haryana Police whisked away Preetpal, and he had then gone \u201cmissing\u201d. Sarwan Singh Pandher, the coordinator of Kisan Mazdoor Morcha, alleged that Preetpal was taken away from the Punjab side and tortured by the Haryana Police. The Haryana Police then put out a clarification that he was under treatment at PGI Rohtak. But, as the Akali Dal raised the matter and Preetpal\u2019s father moved a habeas corpus plea, the High Court intervened to get him shifted to PGIMERChandigarhfor treatment. Preetpal\u2019s brother told the media he had suffered multiple fractures, in his limbs and face, and that many of his teeth were broken. Next, Punjab Chief Secretary Anurag Verma wrote a letter to his Haryana counterpart seeking that Preetpal be handed over to the Punjab government and seeking to know if any other farmer was under treatment in Haryana. Verma underlined that the Punjab government was providing free treatment to all the farmers injured in scuffles at the border with security forces. The Haryana government showed first signs of wilting under the pressure when it dropped a hasty, late-night move ordering the NSA against farmer union leaders, after the February 21 violence, within hours. The Haryana Police said that the NSA had not been actually invoked, just the process \u201cinitiated\u201d. A senior government official admitted that there was realisation that invoking the NSA would prove counterproductive, and could invite a backlash from not just farmers but also other sections of the society. Subsequently, farmer leaders and activists detained in Hisar district after they announced that they would march to Khanauri to express solidarity with the injured protesters were released. Internet restrictions in almost all Haryana districts affected by the protests have been lifted, while in theBudgetthat was just tabled in the House, the Khattar government announced waiving off of interest on farm loans and penalty against those farmers who pay the due principal amount by May 31. The Haryana BJP has also started a social media campaign highlighting its government\u2019s various measures when it comes to the rural sector. However, the farmer leaders from Haryana who are supporting the protest say police are still visiting their houses to put pressure on their family members. \u201cThey are trying to intimidate us,\u201d says Tejveer Singh, the spokesperson of BKU Shaheed Bhagat Singh Haryana. Trinamool Congress leader Shahjahan Sheikh, wanted for land grab and sexual harassment cases, was arrested by West Bengal Police from Minakhan area. He had been on the run since January 5 when his supporters attacked ED officials. The Calcutta High Court had directed that he could be arrested by CBI, ED, or state police. Protests against his aides have caused tension between TMC and BJP.

genetic map of the country", "content": "The government\u2019s Genome India initiative on Tuesday (February 27) announced thesuccessful sequencing of 10,000 whole genomesof healthy persons from across the country, creating a genetic map of the population. Researchers from 20 science institutes across the country helped in collecting the blood samples, sequencing the genome, developing a methodology, and storing the data. With each sequence requiring 80 GB storage space, the huge dataset of 8 petabytes will be stored at the Indian Biological Data Centre in Faridabad. This dataset will be made available to researchers as \u201cdigital public good.\u201d The data can be utilised to develop new diagnostics, targeted therapies, identify new rare diseases, and cure existing ones. The Genome India project was approved by the government in 2020 with the aim of creating a comprehensive catalogue of genetic variations found in the Indian population. A map of genetic diversity is essential for understanding the history of our evolution, discovering the genetic basis for various diseases, and creating therapies of the future. This cannot be done using data available in existing international databases, as Indian genomes are likely to be different from that of other populations. Researchers who analysed 5,750 of thegenome sequenceshave already identified 135 million genetic variants found in India. This map will also create a unique resource. This is because our population of 1.4 billion consists of more than 4,600 distinct groups. With endogamy \u2014 marrying within the same community \u2014 common in India, the various groups have maintained their distinct genetic makeup. This can help compare and contrast the impact of genetic variations on physical health. Union Science minister Dr Jitendra Singh described India as the \u201clargest genetic lab in the world.\u201d The human genome is essentially a biological instruction manual that we inherit from our parents. It is a tome written with just four letters, A,C,G, and T \u2014 the four bases that come together to create everyone\u2019s unique genetic makeup. There are around 3 billion pairs of bases in the complete human genome. This contains all the information needed to create your physical form and maintain it throughout life. From your height, colour of the eyes, the genetic diseases you get or those you are at a higher risk for, everything is determined by the genetic makeup. To sequence the genome, researchers first extract the information from the blood. With a complete sequence of 3 billion pairs being extremely hard to handle, scientists cut it up into small pieces and tag them \u2014 like you would when you disassemble furniture. The A,C, G, T code of these smaller chunks are written down by a DNA sequencer and then the complete sequence is put together. One, it can help identify the genetic basis or genetic risk factors for various diseases. Prof K Thangaraj, who leads the project and is a senior scientist at the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology inHyderabad, cited the example of a mutation, MYBPC3, which leads to cardiac arrest at a young age. It is found in 4.5% of the Indian population but is rare globally. Another mutation called LAMB3 causes a lethal skin condition. It is found in nearly 4% of the population near Madurai, but it is not seen in global databases. Two, it can help in targeted treatments, especially for rare diseases that usually arise from genetic anomalies. \u201cAn Indian genome database will have a significant impact on treatments for genetic diseases. It can help develop new therapies that can cure these diseases,\u201d said Department of Biotechnology (DBT) Secretary Dr Rajesh Gokhale. Take for example the under-development mRNA vaccine to prevent relapse of pancreaticcancer, which is based on a genetic mutation that allowed a small group of pancreatic cancer patients beat the odds. The mutation allowed their immune system to identify the cancer cells and attack them. It can also help in identifying resistance-indicating variants \u2014 for example, genes that might make certain medicines or anaesthetics ineffective in certain populations. An example from India is a set of a Vaishya community from South India, who lack the gene for properly processing common anaesthetics. For this group, use of such anaesthetics can result in death. How long did the project take? The first whole human genome was sequenced with the collaboration of an international team. It took 13 years and $3 billion, and was completed in 2003. India announced its first complete human genome in 2009. \u201cThe technology has come a long way. Now, it takes only about five days to sequence an entire human genome and perform all the quality checks. In fact, we were able to sequence the entire 10,000 genomes in a matter of three to four months,\u201d said Dr Gokhale. A majority of the time was spent on collecting patient samples and their health history. The samples were collected from the remotest parts of the country, covering various tribal populations as well. In all, 99 distinct population groups were covered by the project. The collection was delayed multiple times due to theCovid-19pandemic. \u201cThis is a significant milestone. We now have a baseline map of the country,\u201d said Dr Gokhale.

"headline": "As Left reveals its cards in Kerala, why Congress may still want Rahul Gandhi from Wayanad", "content": "With the CPI announcing senior leader Annie Raja as its candidate from the Wayanad Lok Sabha seat, currently represented by Rahul Gandhi, the question of a constituency for the Congress leader has resurfaced. While the CPI is a part of the INDIA coalition at the national level, as is its larger partner, they are bitter rivals of the Congress in Kerala. It is understood that the Left Democratic Front led by the CPI(M) will have no truck with the Congress-led United Democratic Front in the state. In fact, the two Left parties, which have already announced their candidates for the Lok Sabha seats, have been vocal in asking the Congress to consider a seat for Rahul in some other state, particularly where the party\u2019s chief rival is theBJP. In an interview toThe Indian Express,Annie Raja said:\u201cWhat is the gain for the Congress orRahul Gandhiin contesting from Kerala? \u2026 The Congress has many options for a safer seat for its leadership. It can be in Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Karnataka \u2026 so many places.\u201d While the Congress announced on Wednesday that it will contest 16 seats in Kerala as part of its UDF alliance, it is yet to put out candidate names. The Congress state unit, however, said it wanted Rahul to contest fromWayanadagain. In 2019, not only had the constituency helped the Congress leader save face, since he lost from family bastion Amethi in Uttar Pradesh to the BJP\u2019s Smriti Irani, his candidature had also powered the party\u2019s sweep in Kerala. Rahul had won Wayanad that time with a massive 64.8% of the vote share, against another CPI candidate. In fact, Wayanad has been a safe Congress seat, with the party winning it the last three times by substantial margins \u2013 one reason why the party picked it for Rahul. In the last Assembly polls too, held two years after the Lok Sabha elections, the Congress was a dominant party in the seven segments that comprise the Wayanad Lok Sabha seat. This was despite the LDF coming back to power in an unprecedented result for Kerala. In the 2014 and 2009 Lok Sabha elections, the Wayanad seat was won by late Congress leader M I Shanavas. The 2014 polls saw the closest contest between the two parties of the last three elections, but still 20,987 votes separated them. In 2009, Shanavas had won by 1.53 lakh votes. In the 2021 Assembly elections, the Congress secured a combined vote share of 34.5% in the seven segments falling under Wayanad, compared to its main rival CPI(M)\u2019s 25.6%. While the CPI has largely contested from the Wayanad seat in the Lok Sabha polls as part of the LDF, the Assembly segments mostly fall in the CPI(M)\u2019s kitty. That year, the Congress won three of the seven segments, followed by two for the CPI(M), one for UDF and INDIA member Indian Union Muslim League (IUML), and one for an Independent. In the 2016 Assembly polls, however, the CPI(M) was ahead of the Congress, with its combined vote share in Wayanad of 30.3% a shade more than the Congress\u2019s 26.9%. The CPI(M) won three of Wayanad\u2019s Assembly segments, followed by two for the Congress and one each for the IUML and an Independent. In 2011, when the Congress came out on top, the gap was even closer, with the party getting 31.1% of the votes compared to the CPI(M)\u2019s 29.5%. The UDF had swept all seven segments in Wayanad \u2013 the Congress won four, the IUML two and ally Socialist Janata (Democratic) one. From 1977 and 2004, before Wayanad was created by way of delimitation, the Lok Sabha seat was split across three constituencies \u2013 Calicut, Cannanore and Manjeri. In the nine elections held in that period, the Congress won Calicut and Cannanore six times each, but never won Manjeri. The Left parties won Calicut and Manjeri just once, and Cannanore three times. The CPI\u2019s only win in this period was from Cannanore in 1977. Weeks before the general elections, IE 100, the list of the 100 most powerful Indians this year, maps the lay of the land \u2014 the BJP holding strong, the Opposition trying to hold it together.

V Ananda Bose on Thursday welcomed thearrest of absconding Trinamool Congress leader and Sandeshkhali strongman Shahjahan Sheikh,saying that the move might be a new dawn of lawfulness in the state. \u201cI told you that there will be light at the end of the tunnel. That is democracy. We waited, but it has been done. This is a lesson for everyone. Now, let\u2019s hope a new dawn of lawfulness will come back to Bengal,\u201d Bose said. On Monday, the Governor had given a 72-hour \u201cdeadline\u201d to the state government to arrest the TMC leader. On Thursday morning, the West Bengal Police arrested him in Minakhan, around 30 km away from the island of Sandeshkhali. He was taken to Basirhat court which remanded him in police custody for 10 days. Sheikh and his aides are among the key accused in cases of land grab and sexual harassment that surfaced following violent protests in Sandeshkhali island of North 24 Parganas district. He had been absconding since January 5 after a team of ED officials was attacked by a mob of his supporters near his residence in Sandeshkhali. Sandeshkhali has been witnessing widespread protests against local strongman Sheikh from the beginning of February, with women accusing his close aides Uttam Sardar and Shivprasad Hazra of sexual harassment. The protests have led to the TMC and theBJPtaking potshots at each other even as the police are trying to restore peace in the area. Weeks before the general elections, IE 100, the list of the 100 most powerful Indians this year, maps the lay of the land \u2014 the BJP holding strong, the Opposition trying to hold it together.

"headline": "As BJP eyes first Lok Sabha win in Kashmir, a PDP veteran central to its plans", "content": "The BJP-led Union government\u2019s decision to grant the Scheduled Tribe (ST) status to the linguistic Pahari community in Jammu and Kashmir has given a new lease of life to the political career of former Deputy Chief Minister of the erstwhile state Muzaffar Baig, and revealed the party\u2019s efforts and strategy to win its first Lok Sabha seat in Kashmir. The BJP currently holds the Udhampur and Jammu Lok Sabha seats in the Union Territory. Baig, who is a Pahari, returned to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) last month butsprung a surprise last weekby attending Prime MinisterNarendra Modi\u2019s public rally inJammuand said he was not part of the PDP.\u00a0 The veteran leader\u2019s move to disassociate himself from the party of which he is a founder member was a surprise given that he had joined PDP presidentMehbooba Muftiat the grave of party founder Mufti Mohammad Sayeed in south Kashmir\u2019s Bijbehara on his ninth death anniversary. At the time, Baig said he had not left the PDP but had been \u201cinactive\u201d. The veteran leader\u2019s decision to return to the PDP was viewed by some in the party as an attempt to regain his political relevance as his stint with Sajad Lone\u2019s Peoples Conference, which he formally joined in March 2021, did not last long and he was expelled within a few months. With the Centre granting ST status to Paharis, Baig has more to gain in a partnership with theBJP. The ruling party at the Centre wants Pahari support as the community holds sway in Poonch and Rajouri, which are now part of the south Kashmir parliamentary seat of Anantnag. The BJP will be hoping for a consolidation of Hindu and Pahari votes to win its first Lok Sabha seat in Kashmir, a victory that will hold great value for the party. Apart from that, the Baramulla parliamentary seat also has a sizeable Pahari population. While the leaders of the community say they feel indebted to the BJP for \u201cthis huge favour of giving them ST status and want to repay\u201d them, they feel any open support for the party would damage their own prospects in the Assembly polls. Some Pahari leaders have promised support to a BJP-backed Independent candidate, preferably a Pahari, and this is where Baig comes into the picture. With the BJP\u2019s support, Baig is likely to contest as an Independent from either Baramulla or Anantnag. Pahari leaders are said to be insisting that he be fielded from Anantnag, a seat that Mufti Mohammad Sayeed and Mehbooba both have represented. It is currently held by the National Conference\u2019s Hasnain Masoodi. Meanwhile, the Peoples Conference on Monday announced that Sajad Lone would contest from Baramulla, making it difficult for Baig to feature from there as the two of them in the fray would split the Pahari votes. Trinamool Congress leader Shahjahan Sheikh, wanted for land grab and sexual harassment cases, was arrested by West Bengal Police from Minakhan area. He had been on the run since January 5 when his supporters attacked ED officials. The Calcutta High Court had directed that he could be arrested by CBI, ED, or state police. Protests against his aides have caused tension between TMC and BJP.

"Indian Express", "headline": "\u2018Have ambitious goal\u2026 expect India to be Saudi\u2019s No. 1 tourist source by 2030\u2019: APAC president Alhasan Aldabbagh", "content": "With 275 direct flights every week between the two countries, Saudi Arabia is betting big on the Indian tourist footfall. Last year, the country recorded 1.5 million Indian travellers, a 50% jump over 2022, and aims to amplify this number in the coming decade. Alhasan Aldabbagh, president of Asia-Pacific (APAC) markets of the Saudi Tourism Authority, who is on a visit toDelhi, tells DIVYA A his country has launched a range of initiatives for this \u2014 from establishing VFS (Visa Facilitation Services) offices in nine Indian cities to visa liberalisation and enhanced air connectivity. Edited excerpts from the interview: India has long been an important partner for Saudi Arabia, reflecting the centuries-old economic and socio-cultural ties. We now have a very ambitious goal for India. We expect India, which is currently No. 3, to be the No. 1 inbound market for Saudi by 2030. Last year, we hosted over 1.5 million Indian travelers, making a substantial increase of 50% from 2022. This surge is attributed to strategic initiatives, including a partnership with the Indian Premier League, enhanced air connectivity and the establishment of 10 VFS offices across India. We aim to host 7.5 million Indian visitors by 2030. Medina, Riyadh, Jeddah and AlUla remain the top destinations for visitors\u2026 Heritage-focused travel takes the lead as a holiday preference for Indian travellers and Saudi has been promoting its history and culture to attract tourists from around the world, including India. Key initiatives include the restoration and preservation of heritage sites such as Al-Ula and Diriyah, and the development of cultural festivals and events that showcase Saudi\u2019s traditions and customs. It has never been easier to visit Saudi. Enhanced air connectivity and visa initiatives are key to opening Saudi to Indian travellers. Indian passport holders with a UK, US or Schengen visa that has been utilised at least once are eligible for an e-visa online. The stopover visa allows Indian passengers flying with Saudia (flag carrier of Saudi Arabia) or Flynas ( private Saudi low-cost airline) to spend up to 96 hours in the country. With 10 VFS Tasheel offices located across Indian cities, our goal is to enable a seamless travel experience to Saudi. The Red Sea is known for its pristine landscape with the world\u2019s fourth-largest barrier reef system, 90 untouched islands, mountains and mangroves \u2014 all in one place. It will soon have its very own airport, The Red Sea International Airport. We have also taken steps to embrace eco-friendly practices by enhancing biologically diverse habitats including mangroves, seagrass, corals and land vegetation. Another new island destination in the Red Sea is Sindalah, which will be the first physical showcase of NEOM (a new destination being created in Northwestern Saudi). It is a $500 billion giga-project being built as a zero-carbon smart city that will run on renewable energy. India remains one of Saudi\u2019s top three inbound source markets and holds a pivotal role in realising Vision 2030.

"headline": "Gur and khandsari stage revival through new production technology and savvy marketing", "content": "From cottage and bulk commodity to automated production and consumer brand marketing \u2013 that\u2019s what some entrepreneurs are attempting withgur(jaggery) andkhandsari(unrefined country sugar) in western Uttar Pradesh (UP). K.P. Singh, owner of Hans Heritage Jaggery and Farm Produce, has an interesting background. The 67-year-old is a former group head (operations) of Balrampur Chini Mills Ltd, who, between 2002 and 2018, helped expand the company from 3 to 10 sugar factories and from one to 4 distilleries. He also worked earlier as chief engineer with DCM Shriram and Dwarikesh Sugar Industries Ltd. In 2018, Singh bought 3 acres of land at Sikanderpur in Shamli district\u2019s Unn tehsil for Rs 1.5 crore. On that land, about 9 km from his native village of Unn, he invested another Rs 14 crore to set up India\u2019s first automated, pollution-freegurplant. \u201cI wanted it to be in my village where we farm 60bigha(10 acres). But Unn had a mill (of Bajaj Hindusthan Sugar) and the rules didn\u2019t permit a power crusher to come up within 7.5 km distance from an existing factory. I then chose this site, which is also 8.5 km from the Shamli sugar mill (of Sir Shadi Lal Enterprises),\u201d said Singh. Traditionalgur-makingkolhushave a single diesel engine-driven crusher with a vertical roller. The juice they extract from sugarcane is boiled in open pans, usually three and sometimes four. The fuel used for boiling is bagasse, the fibrous residue remaining after juice extraction and constituting up to 30% of the cane weight. The juice is boiled to about 75 degrees Celsius in the first pan, along with a sticky solution made frombhindi(okra) plant stems. The latter binds with the various impurities, with the resultant scum settling at the surface of the boiling juice and ladled off. The clarified juice is further boiled to 110 degrees or more in the next two pans. The boiled and concentrated syrup is finally taken to a flat platform (chak), where it cools and formsgur. Akolhucan crush 10-20 tonnes of cane daily (tcd). Every 10 tonnes crushed yields around 1.2 tonnes of gur, with 80% sugar and 20% non-sugar (mainly iron and other micronutrients) content. Khandsariunits have power connection for crushing cane, but, likekolhus, use bagasse to boil the juice in open pans. They normally have two crushers, each with three horizontal rollers of 12\u00d718 inches size. Their capacities range from 50-70 tcd (with two crushers) to 150 tcd (four crushers), with 9 (3 of 3-in-series) or 12 (4 of 3) boiling pans.Khandsariis made by transferring the concentrated liquidgurto a crystalliser pan, where it is slowly rotated and cooled for 1-2 days to form coarse sugar. The recovery ofkhandsariand gur in power crushers is 13-14%, higher than the average 12% inkolhus. Singh\u2019s plant has four crushers, each with three larger rollers of 20\u00d730 inches, and 250 tcd capacity, expandable to 500 tcd. It makes only gur, no khandsari. \u201cMyguris natural and black.Kolhusaddmasala(sodium hydrosulphite) and sugar in the boiling juice, the former to give their gur a golden hue and the latter to make it crisp. I add neither. Natural black jaggery has 80% sugars and 20% non-sugars. In regularkolhu gur, that ratio could be 95:5 due to added sugar,\u201d he claimed. Singh\u2019sgurunit runs on grid power through a 500 kilovolt-ampere (400 kilowatt) connection. There\u2019s no biomass burning; the entire bagasse byproduct from cane crush is sold. Boiling of juice happens in plate evaporators (as against open pans). The clarified juice is evaporated first by a heat pump (which provides water at both 65 degrees Celsius and 20 degrees for cooling in thegurgodown) and a mechanical vapour re-compressor (which takes the 65-degrees stored water to 105-110 degrees). The semi-solid jaggery is then poured into stainless steel moulds to cool and set. The technology for Singh\u2019s first-of-its-kind automatedgurplant, commissioned in the first week of January 2023, was supplied by the Mohali (Punjab)-based Spray Engineering Devices Ltd. \u201cIn the 2022-23 season (November-April), we produced 400 tonnes ofgurfrom crushing 4,000 tonnes of cane. This season, we may crush 12,000 tonnes and produce 1,800 tonnes at 15% average recovery,\u201d Singh added. At Fugana village in neighbouring Muzaffarnagar district\u2019s Budhana tehsil, crushing is on at fellow Jat entrepreneur Yashpal Malik\u2019s 150-tcd power crusher. Started two years ago at a cost of Rs 4 crore, it makesgur,khandsari,shakkar(powdered jaggery), sugarcane vinegar and value-added products. These \u2013 sold under the \u2018Freyr\u2019 and \u2018Kisan Shri\u2019 brands \u2013 include chocolate, fruit & nut and \u201cimmunity booster\u201d jaggery cubes;masala chaijaggery powder; andgur chana. Malik\u2019s plant isn\u2019t as technologically sophisticated as Singh\u2019s, but his company \u2013 Freyr Foods Pvt. Ltd \u2013 makes up for it with new-age marketing. \u201cThere is a growing consumer segment that perceivesguras having medicinal value and being healthier than refined white sugar. We are targeting that,\u201d noted Malik, who plans to form a Jaggery & Khandsari Manufacturers Association or JAKMA. Malik is incidentally also president of the All-India Jat Aarakshan Sangharsh Samiti, a body demanding reservation benefits for the Jat community in government jobs and educational institutions. The real winner from the revival of UP\u2019s traditional sweeteners industry would, however, be farmers. \u201cThey (K.P. Singh\u2019s plant) are paying the same Rs 370 per quintal price as the Unn and Shamli sugar factories. But I get the money in cash immediately after supplying here,\u201d said Ishwar Singh Kashyap, who grows cane on 3.5 acres of land taken ontheka(lease) in Sikanderpur. Mills are required to pay farmers within 14 days of taking cane delivery, but some \u2013 like the two mentioned \u2013 have accumulated huge arrears. Malik\u2019s unit is offering two rates: Rs 370/quintal as immediate cash payment and Rs 380-390 on 14-days credit. \u201cWe need morekolhusand crushers like these to force mills to at least pay us on time,\u201d pointed out Sudhir Chaudhary, a three-acre grower from Jhinjhana village in Shamli\u2019s Kairana tehsil. Competition fromgurandkhandsarimakers may not suit the sugar industry that crushes nearly half of the total cane produced in UP. But farmers like Kashyap and Chaudhary wouldn\u2019t mind it at all.

"headline": "In weeks before Supreme Court scrapped scheme, Govt printed electoral bonds worth Rs 8,350 crore", "content": "From December 29, 2023 until February 15 this year, when the theSupreme Court struck down the electoral bonds (EB) schemeof anonymous political funding, the Government printed 8,350 bonds of Rs one crore face value each. Overall, since 2018, whenthe schemewas launched, the Government printed EBs worth Rs 35,660 crore \u2014 33,000 bonds of Rs one crore face value each and 26,600 bonds of Rs 10 lakh face value each. The information was provided by the Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, in reply to an RTI application filed by Commodore Lokesh K Batra (Retd). According to the RTI reply, commission and printing the EBs cost the Government Rs 13.94 crore, while the State Bank of India (SBI) \u2014 the authorised financial institution under the scheme \u2014 charged it Rs 12.04 crore, inclusive of GST, as commission for sales in 30 phases since the scheme was launched. Donors and political parties were not charged any commission or GST, the information revealed. On February 15, in a historic verdict barely weeks before the Lok Sabha polls were set to be notified, a five-judge Constitution bench, headed by CJI D Y Chandrachud, struck down the EB scheme, saying changes made in the laws to implement it were unconstitutional. Holding the scheme \u201cviolative\u201d of the constitutional right to freedom of speech and expression and right to information, the court did not agree with the Centre\u2019s contention that it was meant to bring about transparency and curb black money in political funding. Although the EC is yet to publish the annual reports of political parties for the financial year 2023-24, between March 2018 and January 2024, the collective amount of funds generated through sale of EBs was Rs 16,518 crore. More than half of the funds extended through EBs so far have gone to theBJP. The party, as per its declarations to the EC, received Rs 6,565 crore via bonds between 2017 and 2023. The Congress was a distant second at Rs 1,123 crore. In its two separate but unanimous verdicts spanning 232 pages, the top court also directed the SBI to submit by March 6 the details of EBs purchased since April 12, 2019 till date to the Election Commission (EC) which will publish the information on its official website by March 13. Although what remains uncertain at the moment is whether the data shared by SBI will be presented in a format that helps one immediately match the bond buyer to the political party that received the same bond. As of now, it is assumed that corporates and high-networth individuals were the principal donors, as indicated by EC records, which show that around 94% of EBs purchased in most of the 30 phases since the scheme was launched were of Rs one crore face value each.

Key Points to Ponder: \u2022 What\u2019s the ongoing story-Six years after he announced the decision to send Indians into space, Prime MinisterNarendra Modion Tuesday presented to the nation the fourselected astronauts-designatewho have been undergoing training under anonymity for the last four years. The four candidates \u2014 Group Captains Prasanth Balakrishnan Nair (47), Angad Pratap (41), Ajit Krishnan (41) and Wing Commander Shubhanshu Shukla (38), all officers of the Indian Air Force \u2014 will follow in the footsteps of Rakesh Sharma, the first and only Indian to have travelled to space, way back in 1984, in a Russian spacecraft. (Two Indian-Americans \u2014 Kalpana Chawla and Sunita Williams \u2014 have also been to space on NASA missions.) \u2022One of the four IAF pilots is likely to fly to the International Space Station later this year as part of a NASA mission, following an agreement between the space agencies of India and the United States last year. What is this agreement all about? For Your Information: \u2022The Gaganyaan missionis India\u2019s first manned space flight that is currently scheduled for next year. The space capsule for Gaganyaan has the capacity to carry three astronauts, but it has not yet been finalised whether two or three astronauts would be sent on that mission. \u2022Only three countries \u2014 the United States, Russia and China \u2014 have sent human spaceflights till now, though over 600 astronauts, including over 70 women, from close to 50 different countries have gone into space. \u2022The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) had started planning for a human spaceflight mission way back in 2004 but the real possibilities opened up only after the success ofChandrayaanand Mangalyaan missions, and the development of the GSLV rocket in the last one decade. \u2022The Gaganyaan mission was originally scheduled for a launch in 2022, to coincide with 75 years of India\u2019s independence, but that schedule got derailed because of the Covid pandemic. From Explained Page: PM Modi announces 4 astronauts for Gaganyaan: Current status of the mission \u2022The first mission flight, Gaganyaan-1, an unmanned test flight to check technology readiness, is expected by the end of 2024. The manned mission, which will take a three-member crew into a low earth orbit of 400 km altitude and return to Earth after three days, will follow. \u2022ISRO will use its LVM3 rocket for all of Gaganyaan missions. LVM3, earlier called GSLV-MkIII, is the Indian space agency\u2019s most powerful launch vehicle that has flown seven times without failure. The rocket consists of liquid stage, solid stage, and cryogenic stage. ISRO has reconfigured all components of LVM3 to meet human rating requirements. On February 14, final tests on the cryogenic engine, known as CE20, were performed. The engine successfully passed the test and was certified for missions that would transport humans to space. \u2022The Vikas engine to be used in the liquid stage, and the solid booster, which is part of the solid stage, have already qualified for the missions. \u2022The special flight engine, which ignites as the rocket lifts off, has completed acceptance tests. These tests certify/ qualify the test performance of the hardware according to the mission requirement. The technology or development is then applied in the final mission. \u2022What do preparations for the human space flight includes? \u2022How will the precursor missions such as Gaganyaan-1 help? \u2022What is the role of Drogue chutes? For Your Information: \u2022The four astronauts completed their generic training at Russia\u2019s Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Centre between February 2020 and March 2021. ISRO signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Glavkosmos, a subsidiary of the Russian space agency Roscosmos, for the training in June 2019. \u2022In 1984, Wing Commander Rakesh Sharma became the first Indian in space when he flew to the Salyut 7 space station on a Soviet spacecraft. In 2006, India started work on an orbital vehicle mission that was later named Gaganyaan.

Key Points to Ponder: \u2022 What\u2019s the ongoing story-THE GOVERNMENT\u2019S ambitiousGenome India initiativeachieved a significant milestone Tuesday as researchers completed sequencing 10,000 healthy genomes from different regions of the country, representing 99 distinct populations. This accomplishment has culminated in the creation of a comprehensive genetic map of India, which holds immense potential for clinicians and researchers alike. For Your Information: \u2022\u201cSequencing 10,000 genomes and creating an Indian repository is a big achievement. The first whole human genome sequence was announced in 2003. It was completed over 13 years at the cost of $3 billion. The technology has come a long way, allowing us to sequence thousands of genomes in a matter of months,\u201d said DBT Secretary Dr Rajesh Gokhale. \u2022An analysis of just 5,750 of the genomes has helped researchers identify 135 million genetic variants found in India. \u201cSome of these variations occur only in certain pockets of the population, while some are commonly found across large parts of the population. This data can now be associated with their physical traits or disease history. This can help us identify disease indicating variants, for example ones that may be causing certain cancers or rare diseases,\u201d said Prof Y Narahari, one of the two people leading the project and a senior scientist at the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru. \u2022\u201cIt can also help in identifying resistance indicating variants, for example genes that might make certain medicines or anaesthetics ineffective in certain populations. It can also help identify targets for diagnostics and therapeutics,\u201d he said. \u2022What are MYBPC3 and LAMB3? \u2022 Important Facts: The entire dataset \u2014 which adds up to 8 petabytes of data \u2014 will be stored at the Indian Biological Data Centre (IBDC) and will be made available as a digital public good or research. Inaugurated in 2022, the IBDC is the country\u2019s only databank. Prior to that Indian researchers had to host their biological datasets on American or European servers. A genome, simply put, is all the genetic matter in an organism. It is defined as \u201can organism\u2019s complete set of DNA, including all of its genes. Each genome contains all of the information needed to build and maintain that organism. In humans, a copy of the entire genome \u2014 more than 3 billion DNA base pairs \u2014 is contained in all cells that have a nucleus\u201d. What is genome sequencing? How will the information be useful in understanding genetic disease and evolution? What is Human Genome Project?

Key Points to Ponder: \u2022 What\u2019s the ongoing story-Krishna Kumar writes: Sporadic experimentation is familiar to students of the history of education in our country. The latest to be tried out is the open-book examination. This, too, is not new, but this time it is expected to reduce the pressure that children are under. The ingredients of this pressure were the object of an inquiry by a committee that gave its report some three decades ago\u2026 With weekly and monthly tests, a breathless routine destroys the child\u2019s search for meaning in what is taught. This failure needs a broader remedy. \u2022 Quick Recall:The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) hasproposed a pilot study to check the feasibility of open book examsfor Classes 9 to 12. The pilot will be held in select schools in November-December for subjects like English, Mathematics and Science for Classes 9 and 10, and English, Mathematics and Biology for Classes 11 and 12. The CBSE has proposed this form of assessment based on the National Curriculum Framework (NCF) released last year. Through this pilot, the Board aims to study the time taken by students to complete such tests and gather feedback from teachers and students. The pilot test will be designed and developed by June, for which the CBSE has soughtDelhiUniversity\u2019s help. \u2022What was the Yash Pal committee? \u2022 What was novelist RK Narayan\u2019s description of children\u2019s daily ordeal? \u2022The popularity of technology and coaching has increased side by side, feeding the new testing style.

According to a 2021 study conducted among medical students of All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Bhubaneswar, open book exams have the benefit of being less stressful. A pilot study, published in Cambridge University Press, was performed to check the feasibility and acceptability of online open-book examination in 2020. The study concluded that among the 98 students, 21.4% failed and 78.6% passed. \u201cOnly 55 students volunteered to give feedback; most agreed that the best advantage of this assessment was that it was stress-free,\u201d the study report said. The disadvantage most students complained of was network connectivity issues. A 2021 study conducted by Dhananjay Ashri and Bibhu P Sahoo on the use of open book exams for the students of DU stated that even though mean marks scored by the students in an OBE is higher than in a closed book exam, the university did not focus on developing the skills required for a student to crack an OBE. Another study conducted by Nirma University\u2019s Nitin Pillai and Mamta Pillai, published in June 2022, stressed on the need to train students on how to write an open book exam and developing the necessary skills of analysing concepts to get the benefits of OBE.

What were the major takeaways of India\u2019s G20 presidency? \u2022Prime MinisterNarendra Modi\u2019s call for Lifestyle for Environment (LiFE) during the COP26 Summit in Glasgow in 2021 is a testament to India\u2019s commitment to global sustainability. What is LiFE? \u2022 For Your Information: India\u2019s support for culture on the global stage is grounded in its rich heritage and demonstrated commitment to holistic sustainability. Our nation\u2019s ancient wisdom and cultural practices are not relics of the past but living resources that offer innovative solutions to contemporary challenges. Sustainability, in its broadest sense, has always been a core tenet of Indian society, enabling us to navigate and prosper amidst centuries of socio-economic complexities. The cultural ethos of India is characterised by mutual co-existence, peace, and interdependence, providing us with a comprehensive approach to addressing modern challenges. India has been able to leverage this heritage to develop innovative solutions by adapting traditional wisdom to modern needs. We are known to make sustainable choices, which makes India one of the least wasteful economies. Old worn-out clothes in Indian households are first handed down and then often used as a duster rather than being disposed of. Similarly, old newspapers, books and other waste materials have been recycled for generations through scrap vendors. We have a culture of attributing value to all resources and frugality has been a way of life. The concept of\u00a0a circular economy, therefore, has been embedded in our lifestyle.

Key Points to Ponder: \u2022 What\u2019s the ongoing story-Nearly 19 months after he retired as a Supreme Court judge, Justice A M Khanwilkar was appointed the chairperson of the anti-corruption ombudsman Lokpal on Tuesday. The post fell vacant nearly two years ago. \u201cPresidentDroupadi Murmuis pleased to appoint Justice Ajay Manikrao Khanwilkar as the chairperson of the Lokpal,\u201d a statement released by Rashtrapati Bhavan said. Justice Khanwilkar had a six-year tenure as an SC judge. In his last year, he authored a series of crucial verdicts that validated the state\u2019s sweeping powers against citizens in special legislations \u2014 the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act and the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Amendment Act. He retired in July 2022. The government has also appointed six members, including three judicial members, to the Lokpal. Former Himachal Pradesh High Court Chief Justice Lingappa Narayana Swamy, former Allahabad High Court Chief Justice Sanjay Yadav and former Karnataka High Court Chief Justice and Law Commission Chairperson Ritu Raj Awasthi are judicial members; non-judicial members include former Chief Election Commissioner Sushil Chandra, former Chief Secretary of Gujarat Pankaj Kumar and former Rural Development Secretary Ajay Tirkey. \u2022 For Your Information: The Lokpal chairperson and the members are appointed for a term of five years or serve till they are 70 years old, whichever is earlier. The first Lokpal chairperson was former Supreme Court Justice Pinaki Chandra Ghose, who had assumed office in March 2019. Since his retirement in May 2022, former Jharkhand HC Chief Justice Pradip Kumar Mohanty has been the acting Lokpal chairperson. \u2022 Quick Recall:Amid repeated demands for such an ombudsman, many attempts were made at legislation, with Lokpal Bills introduced in 1971, 1977, 1985, 1989, 1996, 1998, 2001, 2005 and 2008, but none of these was passed. It was four decades after the introduction of the first Bill that the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act was enacted in December 2013. This was the fallout of a public movement for a Jan Lokpal Bill, initiated by activist Anna Hazare and others such as Kiran Bedi andArvind Kejriwal. Under pressure at a time when it was facing several allegations of corruption, the then UPA government brought the Bill and it was passed after several hurdles. \u2022What are Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act and their respective jurisdictions?

"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-history/lord-krishna-dwarka-under-water-9185774/": {"source": "Indian Express", "headline": "Is Lord Krishna\u2019s Dwarka under water? The many legends, traces of a lost city", "content": "Last week Prime Minister Narendra Modi was in the pilgrimage town of Dwarka, in Gujarat\u2019s Devbhoomi Dwarka district, to inaugurate several infrastructural projects, including theSudarshan Setu, India\u2019s longest cable-stayed project connecting Okha town with the island of Beyt Dwarka. He also wentscuba diving off the Panchkui beach coastand performed underwater prayers at the site of what\u2019s considered to be Dwarka Nagari \u2013 the mythological kingdom of Lord Krishna in the Mahabharata. \u201cI spent those moments which will stay with me forever. I went into the deep sea and saw ancient Dwarika ji. Archeologists have written a lot about submerged Dwarika\u2026While I was seeing Dwarikaji inside the sea, I was experiencing the same grandeur and divinity,\u201d the PM said in his address later. Dwarka has immense significance in Hindu culture due to its association with Lord Krishna and the Mahabharata. It is believed that after killing his uncle Kamsa, Krishna migrated from Mathura to Dwarka with his Yadava clan, and founded his kingdom here by reclaiming 12yojanaland from the sea. To pray in the city of Dwarka, which is immersed in the waters, was a very divine experience. I felt connected to an ancient era of spiritual grandeur and timeless devotion. May Bhagwan Shri Krishna bless us all.pic.twitter.com/yUO9DJnYWo \u2014Narendra Modi(@narendramodi)February 25, 2024 References in the Vishnu Purana suggest that Dwarka was a city of beautiful gardens, moats, ponds and palaces. The town, however, is believed to have been submerged under the sea after the death of Lord Krishna. Present-day Dwarka is a coastal town located at the mouth of the Gulf of Kutch, facing the Arabian Sea. The town is a part of the Krishna pilgrimage circuit, which includes Vrindavan, Mathura, Govardhan, Kurukshetra and Puri, and is home to the 13th-century Dwarkadheesh temple dedicated to Lord Krishna. There are a number of other places scattered along the Saurashtra coast that find a mention in legends associated with Lord Krishna, including Bet Dwarka and Mul Dwarka. Since the beginning of the 20th century, multiple attempts have been made by scholars to establish the precise location of \u2018Dwarka\u2019 as mentioned in the Mahabharata. Most of these accounts, however, relied on ancient literature and works of other scholars. Is it the same as present-day Dwarka? A town that possibly now lies under the sea? Or a mythological town whose historical authenticity may never be established? As noted by Alok Tripathi, Additional Director General of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), in his paper, \u2018Excavations at Dwarka-2007\u2019 (2013), F E Pargiter, the British civil servant and orientalist who was judge at the Calcutta High Court in 1904, had in his translation of the Markandeya Purana suggested for the first time that Dwarka was located on the \u2018Raivataka\u2019, a mountain range mentioned in the Mahabharata, and which is believed to be the present-day Girnar hills in Junagadh, around 200 km away from Dwarka town. Tripathi also quoted historian A S Altekar, who, in the 1920s, \u201cdiscussed that modern Dwarka may not have been as old as 1200 BCE, but accepted that it had been submerged as mentioned in some ancient texts\u201d. Scholar A D Pulsakar in his 1943 essay, \u2018Historicity of Krishna\u2019, suggested that present-day Dwarka is the same as the one mentioned in the Mahabharata. Similar thoughts were expressed by archaeologist H D Sankalia in the 1960s. From the 1960s onwards, attention shifted from ancient literature to finding material evidence for the existence of Lord Krishna\u2019s Dwarka. While the early excavations focused on land around present-day Dwarka, as speculation over a submerged city heightened, later explorations were conducted under water. The first excavation was carried out close to the Dwarkadheesh temple in 1963 by the Deccan College inPune, in association with the Gujarat government\u2019s Department of Archaeology. The excavation had to be carried out in a very limited area since the region around the temple is heavily populated. The excavations revealed that the place had been inhabited for the last 2,000 years. \u201cThese findings did not support the traditional identification with the legendary city, but inspired others to continue their quest and take up further studies,\u201d wrote ASI ADG Tripathi. In 1979, the ASI carried out a second round of excavations under the leadership of archaeologist S R Rao in the area around the Dwarkadheesh Temple during the development of the area. Tripathi explained in his work that although no official report of this excavation was published, the brief review by the ASI Director-General at that time mentioned the finding of remains of three earlier temples and Lustrous Red Ware pottery that could be dated to mid-second millennium BCE. The findings triggered further interest around Dwarka and consequently led to speculations of a submerged ancient settlement. For the next two decades, a long, archaeological quest was carried out by a team of marine archaeologists and scientists from the National Institute of Oceanography (NIO), a laboratory under the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), to find the \u2018sunken\u2019 city in the Arabian Sea. Marine archaeologist Dr Sila Tripati, who was part of the NIO team from 1988 onwards, said that during the course of the underwater excavations, they found about \u201c200 stone anchors, stone structures, stone sculptures, small pieces pottery, some pieces of marble statues, iron anchors and other metal objects\u201d. Talking toThe Indian Express, Sila Tripati explained that the material found was dated by comparing them to the findings from nearby areas. \u201cWhen it comes to the archaeological excavations in Dwarka, one needs to take into account the entire region that includes Bet Dwarka, Nageshwar, Pindara, Gopi Talab among others, all of which are located at a distance of less than 30 kilometres from the town of Dwarka,\u201d he said. \u201cDuring our excavations and explorations at Bet Dwarka, on one side of the island we found evidence dating to the early historical period (from sixth century BCE to sixth century CE). On the other side of Bet Dwarka island, we found evidence from the late Harappan period (approximately 1900 to 1300 BCE). Since the stone anchors found underwater at Dwarka were similar to the Late Harappan findings at Bet Dwarka, we concluded that they were from the same period,\u201d he stated, before underlining that most scholars agree that the Late Harappan era was the period of the Mahabharata. ASI\u2019s Alok Tripathi, however, suggested in his paper that the findings of the NIO, despite generating a lot of public interest, lacked clarity. Consequently, between 2005 and 2007, another round of underwater excavations was carried out, this time by the Underwater Archaeology Wing (UAW) of the ASI, which was led by Alok Tripathi. The underwater excavations, however, revealed that the structural remains found scattered on the sea bed were not in situ, but transported by waves and current. In other words, the artefacts were lying exposed and not buried deep and undisturbed for thousands of years. Consequently, it was not possible to assign a specific date to them. The search continues.

Srivastava writes: Byju\u2019s fall and the failure of fast-food education", "content": "There is an episode inKashinath Singh\u2019s fictionalised Hindi language memoir,Kashi Ka Assi(2004), that goes something like this. It is 1953 and the author has recently arrived in Kashi, having left his village. The young Kashinath has high hopes that the city will be a site of enlightenment and deliverance from the debilitations of rural existence, marked by the dead hand of custom and the economic and cultural dead ends that smother aspirations. Kashinath is staying with an elder brother, another supplicant for the city\u2019s imagined capacities for improving blighted lives. The brother suggests that the first step to secure an alternative future lies in acquiring expertise in the English language and offers an immediate lesson. The teacher leads the pupil to the banks of the Ganges and, facing a peepal tree, orders attentiveness. Standing a little distance away \u2014 \u201cto attention\u201d \u2014 the brother addresses the tree: \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d Then, moving closer to the tree, he responds: \u201cSir, my name is Ramji Singh\u201d. He then moves even further away and asks the tree: \u201cWhat is your father\u2019s name?\u201d and, then, moving closer to it, answers, \u201cSir, my father\u2019s name is Sri Nagar Singh\u201d. The self-appointed mentor repeats his actions till he is exhausted and drenched in sweat. He orders young Kashinath to repeat the exercise. \u201cThe truth to tell\u201d, the perplexed narrator of the tale notes, \u201cI didn\u2019t learn any English but understood that there is some connection between knowledge and perspiration\u201d. There is a sad seriousness to thenovel\u2019s comedythat is a commentary on the futile attempts at social mobility that \u2014 rather than providing an avenue for it \u2014 bind many to the sterile hopes of rote learning. What Kashinath Singh means to point to is that in milieus of desperation, imagined techniques of salvation only condemn supplicants to never-ending cycles of hopelessness. The younger brother comprehends the pointlessness of the exercise the befuddled elder one carries out with mechanistic reverence. An uneven and poorly designed education system, he realises, cannot simply be overcome by occultic conversations with a tree, notwithstanding its sacred status. This pithy episode fromKashi Ka Assicould serve as a cautionary tale regarding theongoing controversy over the edtech firm, Byju\u2019s. The company, as we know, has gone from being (as one media report put it) \u201cIndia\u2019s hottest tech startup\u201d to its most troubled. Over the past six to eight months, it has beenraided by the Enforcement Directorate(ED) over suspicions of foreign exchange violations; accused of financial mismanagement; faced attempts by major investors to oust its founder and allegations of breaching corporate ethics; and had its market worth slashed to a fraction of its earlier value.The Byju\u2019s caseis, however, mainly discussed as an instance of poor corporate strategy rather than \u2014 as Kashinath Singh\u2019s warning-offered-as-bemusement might suggest \u2014 an instance where education has been converted to a five-minute noodle dish. In this process, education \u2014 that process of making us genuinely human \u2014 has been converted to a machine for profit-making without much proof that it produces any public good. The pervasiveness of rote learning as an educational strategy is, not, of course, new and has a relatively long and, by now, well-established modern history. It is serviced by urban dystopias \u2014 consisting of coaching institutes, accommodation and allied industries \u2014 that have taken deep root. Here, failure and success are measured primarily through success in examinations that privilege rote learning. These are, as might be expected, also landscapes of bereavement. The calculus of success and failure pioneered by this system produces grim statistics of youth suicides at its epicentre. Through narrowing the capacity for human thought as well as the possibility of adjusting to changes in economy and society \u2014 when, for example, the nature of jobs changes because of dramatic technological interventions \u2014 this model severely handicaps those who have been entangled in its net. And yet, public commentary on the Byju\u2019s phenomenon continues to be in the languages of good and bad corporate management, imagining education as a packet of chips that has proved unpopular because the promoters forgot to add the right kind of masala mix. The salve for anxieties regarding uncertain futures cannot, however, be found in decrepit, quick-fix and technocratic attitudes towards education. First, there is a vast arena of livelihood choices that can also produce happiness, which has not only been marginalised by the fast-food model of education but also effectively stigmatised. This means that young people with an interest in, say, urban design, filmmaking or journalism, face familial and social pressure to pursue careers for which they might not be suited. Failures at examinations that require capacity for rote learning are, subsequently, experienced as failing one\u2019s family as well as marks of personal inadequacy. Second, there is a difference between acquiring a technical qualification and being subject to a technocratic one. An engineer with broad learning not only builds good bridges but is also equipped with skills of switching tracks should bridge-building go out of fashion. Technocratic education, with its incredibly narrow methods and processes, leads to an incapacity for thinking on one\u2019s feet. Finally, the capacity for thinking broadly derives from learning to engage with human complexity. One of the hallmarks of fast-food education is the withdrawal of students from normal schooling \u2014 an indispensable period of learning the skills of social interaction \u2014 and their insertion into the abnormal milieu of the coaching institute. This produces both under-socialised young people and dysfunctional adults. And, yet, we hear almost nothing about what the \u201cedtech\u201d model means for human capacities and creativity. We hear little about the fact of the great human wastage that multiple years of perspiration and formulaic learning lead to for so many of its hapless subjects.

diplomacy: Govt depts red-flag high duties to curb China imports, seek nuance in strategy", "content": "MULTIPLE WINGS IN the government have started to red-flag the Centre\u2019s moves to progressively hike customs duties, especially the more recent offensive targeted at imports of Chinese components and inputs. A section within the government is in favour of a more nuanced approach in using tariffs as a diplomatic tool, failing which there is a possibility of the gains of India\u2019s manufacturing-focused thrust that include schemes such as Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) being squandered away. What cannot be missed is that China still accounts for 14 per cent of India\u2019s imports with not just inputs for the domestic industry in sectors ranging from electronics to pharmaceuticals and textiles to leather, but also capital goods, being sourced from China. This, coupled with the fact that average tariffs in India have jumped to 18.1 per cent in 2022 from 13 per cent eight years ago in 2014, has made India uncompetitive vis-a-vis countries such as Vietnam, Thailand and Mexico. In fact, much of the protests from ministries have come after the industry warned of the detrimental impact of higher tariffs being used as a protectionism tool. The blockade targeting Chinese imports, which gained traction across Central ministries and departments in the aftermath of the Galwan border clash since 2020, is now seen to be impacting sectors such as electronics and pharmaceuticals. The roadblocks to imports in these sectors is leading to either a loss of domestic output or simply a loss of competitive advantage for Indian manufacturing. After lobby groups representingAppleInc. and other cell phone manufacturers said India\u2019s high tariffs pose a disincentive to de-risking supply chains beyond China. As a result, countries such as Vietnam, Thailand and Mexico are offering lower tariffs on components to grab the space vacated by China.  Earlier this year, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) relayed concerns about high production cost due to high tariffs to the Finance Ministry. MeitY had pushed for a lowering of duties of about 20 per cent on parts including circuit boards, chargers and fully assembled phones, by at least 5 percentage points. This was partly agreed to and the government reduced duty on several IT goods ahead of theInterim Budget2024. Moreover, to check cheap quality imports from China, India imposed Quality Control Orders (QCOs) that restrict MSMEs from getting necessary input material. WHILE India Inc has mostly been at the forefront of pushing for protectionist measures including tariff and non-tariff barriers, it is the industry itself which wants the government to reduce duties on imports of capital goods and key inputs across sectors. \u201cGlobally there is no country where tariffs are so high (as in India). Our tariffs are higher than countries in South East Asia and even Africa. If one were to impose tariffs for a security reason, it is different. (For that) there are safeguard measures of the Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR). We are currently negotiating FTAs with developed countries which have maximum tariffs at 60 per cent\u2026 that too on products such as tobacco. Our highest tariffs go up to 150 per cent. Of course, we are different from developed nations and we need to reduce tariffs in a calibrated manner. Commerce will have to work on it,\u201d a government official involved in the tariff negotiations said on condition of anonymity. \u201cAll imports are not bad. Our economy will not grow if we start blocking imports. When Galwan (conflict) happened, there was no official order but all imports from China were stuck. This resulted in our own offices being filled with requests from domestic industry including textiles and leather. Each and every input comes from China. They missed (export) orders and faced a penalty. Protectionism is not nationalism. It only brings inefficiency. You can give some time to your industry but you cannot give protection till eternity,\u201d the official said.  India accounts for negligible share in China\u2019s total trade, but significantly depends on Chinese imports in key sectors including pharmaceuticals and electronics. Official data shows that India is home to barely 3 per cent of Chinese exports. But China is one of India\u2019s biggest import sources, making up for 14 per cent of India\u2019s total imports, especially with regard to intermediate goods and capital goods. This dependency has left India vulnerable to supply chain disruption. \u201cIf you look at the trade data in the last 10 years\u2026 we have not gained in our FTAs with Korea and Japan. Our textile and leather industry sought access in Japan and Korea but they gained more and our exports remained flat. So, from the perspective of development economics, it makes sense to gradually decrease duties and integrate better with global markets and then negotiate FTAs,\u201d a second government official said on condition of anonymity. An internal study by industry lobby group India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA) that analysed input tariffs across five countries \u2014 China, Thailand, Vietnam, Mexico and India \u2014 has noted that India has the highest tariffs on inputs in the electronic segment. The high tariffs, it said, is impacting competitiveness and that the industry is seeking reduction of tariffs to levels in Vietnam, which offers lower tariffs for about 98 per cent tariff lines compared with India, while Thailand offers lower tariffs for over 90 per cent of goods. An industry player from the electrical industry talked of the futility of slapping import duties on items where India has a natural advantage, including aluminium, polymers and petrochemicals. While industry does not need higher duty as a safeguard, the imposition of tariff walls lead domestic producers to hike prices to the extent of the duty, thereby impacting overall competitiveness of the industry. Also, these hikes in import duties render India\u2019s exports uncompetitive, given that a significant portion of exports are import-intensive. More importantly, trade barriers end up promoting inefficiencies in domestic manufacturing, at the cost of hurting consumers. Tariff hikes have been undertaken by the NDA government multiple times covering well over 500 major item categories since 2016, marking a \u201ccalibrated departure\u201d from the policy of reducing import duty that has been followed by successive governments over the last two decades. The Ministry of Commerce denies these duty increases are \u201cprotectionist\u201d in nature. An official said India\u2019s stance on hiking tariffs mirrored the broader trend globally, and that NewDelhihad shown a renewed interest in signing bilateral Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) over the last 24 months. While both statements have an element of truth, India\u2019s tariff hikes clearly started well before the largely post-pandemic mood of protectionism in the western world kicked in. Also, while India is currently negotiating a record number of bilateral trade deals, it has chosen to stay out of important mega regional trading arrangements, including the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). Analysts caution that in some cases where customs duty hikes have been proposed, duties are close to or have effectively crossed the WTO-mandated \u201cbound rates\u201d. These are the customs duty rates that a country commits to all other members under the MFN principle, and breaching these rates could effectively put a country at risk of being branded as \u201cprotectionist\u201d as per WTO norms that prohibit discrimination by use of tariffs by its 164 members There is also a clash between two contrasting viewpoints within the government \u2013 of India\u2019s domestic market being a bargaining chip and high tariff walls forcing foreign companies to manufacture here to take advantage of India\u2019s market size, as against the other point of view that domestic cost competitiveness is important for export competitiveness and that can only happen with lower tariffs. Some of the tariff hikes initiated over the last two years have come despite protests from the industry and even within sections of the government itself. In February 2020, Indian toy traders, retailers, wholesalers, and manufacturers came together to form an umbrella body, the All India Toys Federation, to protest the hike of import duty on toys in that year\u2019s budget. Earlier too, the withdrawal of concessional customs duties on 76 specified drugs in January 2016 had to be partly withdrawn after the Ministry of Health cited an adverse impact on the prices and availability of these drugs. The implementation of the duty hike on solar panels from September 2017 was opposed by both the New and Renewable Energy Ministry and solar project developers. The withdrawal of the exemption from basic customs duty on \u2018cashew nuts in shell\u2019 in Budget 2016-17 resulted in representations from various trade and industry associations seeking a withdrawal of the imposition of the duty of 5 per cent on cashew nuts in the shell. The official argument is that these calibrated changes in duty rates \u201cwill help the domestic industry in capacity creation\u201d, \u201cproviding a level playing field\u201d, \u201ceasing the raw material supply side constraints\u201d and \u201cenhancing ease of doing business\u201d. But analysts who counter this view say that the nearly eight years of protectionism have not pushed up the share of manufacturing in India\u2019s GDP \u2014 levels of around 15 per cent have been steady for well over a decade, despite multiple sops that include unprecedented tax breaks.

{"source": "Indian Express", "headline": "Beyond Sita and Akbar, zoos cheered Ram, Mumtaz, Tendulkar and Azadi", "content": "Tripurasuspended its top forest officiallast week for recording two lions as Sita and Akbar, after the Calcutta High Court cautioned against naming zoo animals after deities and prominent figures revered by people. Official records show that in zoos across India, for years, naming animals hardly set off any ripples. In the 1970s, Gujarat\u2019s Junagadh zoo, for example, paired lion Ram with lioness Mumtaz, while cubs born to tigress Radha and tiger Krishna in Mysore zoo were named Mumtaj and Safdar in 1980. Long before the Calcutta HC put even freedom fighters on the no-go list, Azadi was a proud lioness born in the same Junagadh zoo in 2004. Entertaining a petition against the naming and pairing of Sita and Akbar, two zoo lions transferred from Tripura to West Bengal, Justice Saugata Bhattacharyya had on February 22 said his conscience did not support such naming. \u201cIt is not just Sita. I also do not support naming a lion as Akbar. Will you name a lion Samrat Ashok?\u201d he said. It turns out that Gujarat\u2019s Junagadh zoo had, indeed, named a lion Ashok in 1991. Odisha\u2019s Nandankanan zoo, too, had named two tigers Ashok in 1981 and 1994. In 2000, when the younger Ashok fathered a male cub with tigress Tanuja, the same zoo named it Shamsher. Tanuja, incidentally, was the daughter of tiger Viswamitra, named after one of the Vedic Saptarishi (seven venerated sages). Tiger Viswamitra\u2019s brother was aptly named Vasistha, a fellow Saptarishi.  According to the Central Zoo Authority\u2019s National Studbooks (2018 editions) that contain pedigree information of endangered species such as tigers and lions in captivity since the 1950s, both Sita and Akbar have been popular names in zoos across India.Mumbai\u2019s Byculla zoo named a lioness Sita in 1996. At least 13 tigresses have been named Sita/Seeta/Seetha by 12 zoos in Karnataka,Delhi, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Assam, Punjab, Bihar, Rajasthan and Odisha since 1974. In 2011, a male cub born to lion Atul and lioness Sonia was named Akbar inHyderabadzoo. One of Akbar\u2019s sisters from the same litter was named Laxmi. In 1981, Mysore zoo named a litter of three tiger cubs Amar, Akbar and Anthony. Mangalore zoo did the same in 2016. Zoo cats and three identities Records show that dozens of big cats in Indian zoos have shared their names with religious and mythological figures such as Brahma, Shiva, Krishna, Balaram, Shankar, Parvati, Durga, Saraswati, Laxmi, Ganesh, Karthik, Ganga, Radha, Yashoda, Kunti, Rukmini, Ram,Lava, Kusha, etc.. Even the Dalai Lama shares his name with a snow leopard that Darjeeling zoo named Tenzin in 2021. Every zoo cat has three identities: the number on its transponder microchip, its number in the national studbook and a local house name. \u201cBe it a big cat or an ape, when a captive animal needs handling as an individual, a house name is necessary for communication,\u201d said a former animal keeper of theKolkatazoo. But house names, pointed out P R Sinha, the former director of Central Zoo Authority (CZA) and Wildlife Institute of India (WII), do not matter in the context of animal exchange or breeding that relies on studbooks. \u201cAt times, it may appear ridiculous how randomly the animals are named. But it is even more ridiculous to go looking for motives (in such naming),\u201d he said.  Nobody batted an eyelid in 1955 when Madhya Pradesh\u2019s Rewa zoo named the cub of Mohan and Begum \u2014 both captured in the wild \u2014 Radha, India\u2019s first zoo tigress with a known pedigree. That tradition has continued.Punezoo named two cubs born to tigress Kaikei as Sultan (1992) and Mastani (1994). Tigress Hasina\u2019s three cubs were named Krishna, Balaram and Subhadra in Andhra Pradesh\u2019s Tirupati in 2012. Occasionally, zoos followed the script. Tigers Karan and Arjun were born to tigress Kunti in Delhi in 2001. Likewise, tiger Ganesh (1991) and tigress Saraswati (1992) were born to tiger Shankar and tigress Parvati inChhattisgarh\u2019s Bhilai. Then it went haywire. In 1999, tiger Ganesh sired a cub Vikas with tigress Parvati, and another three cubs Vishnu, Krishna and Durga with tigress Saraswati. Indeed, house names have never come in the way of selecting zoo cats for captive breeding. In 1978, for example, tigress Seeta was paired with tiger Balram in Punjab\u2019s Chhatbir zoo. In 1991, Pune zoo paired tigress Laxmi with tiger Anthony. Conversely, couples in mythology or history became siblings in their zoo tiger avatars: Ram and Sita (1995, Madhya Pradesh\u2019s Shivpuri), Sabitri and Satyaban (1987, Nandankanan); and Bajirao and Mastani (2003, Mumbai\u2019s Borivali). Sample some more random nomenclature: 1976:Tigress Surpneka was fathered by tiger Krishna in Mysore. 1987:Tigress Begum was fathered by tiger Shiva in Kolkata. 1997:Tigresses Gypsy and Razia were born to tigress Laxmi in Pune. 1998:Tiger Badsha was born to tigress Gayatri in Kolkata. 2004:Tiger Kaif was born to tigress Seeta in Aurangabad. 2010:Lion Taukir was born to lioness Tulsi and lion Sarjit in Junagadh. 2011:Tiger Shiva was born to tigress Menaka in Karnataka\u2019s Bannerghatta. 2016:Tiger Sultan was born to tigress Ganga in Bhilai, and lion Shankar fathered lion Sultan in Etawah. A tiger named Jackie and a lion named Kargil Moreover, changing names as suggested by the Calcutta HC is not as simple as it sounds. \u201cThe relation between an animal and its keeper is crucial for its well-being. It is difficult to make animals respond to new names overnight. That\u2019s why often a name used during an animal\u2019s initial days sticks for good,\u201d says a zoo veterinarian based in Gujarat. Some names are influenced by recent events. In 1999, Kanpur zoo named a lion Kargil. In 1983, the year Hero became a blockbuster, Patna zoo named a tiger Jackie. In 1996, after India bagged the Miss World title in 1994, a tigress in Kanpur zoo was named Aishwarya. In 2002, Bengaluru\u2019s Bannerghatta zoo named three tiger cubs from two litters Dravid, Tendulkar and Kalpana Chawla. Film stars and cricketers dominate the list of celebrities who share their names with zoo cats. Some zoo cats were perhaps named more fittingly. In 1967, a tiger captured from the wild was lodged in Delhi zoo as Jim (after hunter-naturalist Corbett). In 1984, another wild tiger landed in Kanpur zoo as Sheroo. Junagadh zoo named two male lion cubs as Mufasa and Simbha in 1996. But there are few such options. \u201cWhere does it end when you start nitpicking? Would a (lioness) Jessica or a (tigress) Diana stir old wounds? What about (lioness) Azadi? Will zoo cats be left with only names like (tigers) Chedilal (Lucknow), Shammi or (tigress) Pummy (Chhatbir)?\u201d asked a former director of Delhi zoo. One safe option, he said, is to name zoo cats after the human perception of their dominant traits. The national studbook has zoo tigers named Jhagru (1968, Delhi), Petu (1987, Vanvihar), Fattu (1997, Chhatbir) and Chotu (2003, Chhatbir). A Chhatbir zoo tigress was even named Chorni in 2003. But would the big cats not take offence if they had the right to? They certainly might, agreed the former Delhi zoo director, if a tiger is named Puppy (1988, Chhatbir) ever again.

Express", "headline": "Why the Opposition is in a corner of its own making", "content": "Amidst \u201cinformed guesses\u201d that the coming parliamentary election will be easy for the BJP, one would have expected spirited efforts by the Opposition to mobilise the electorate and corner the ruling party on key developments such as the Supreme Court ruling on electoral bonds or the farmers\u2019 agitation. Instead, what we witness is an aggressive BJP poaching the Opposition, in north and south, and openly waging a war against farmers. This stark asymmetry between the approaches of the ruling party and the Opposition cannot be understood merely in the framework of anti-democratic manoeuvres of the ruling party \u2014 they are a given in a polity that tilts towards upholding sub-democratic politics as democracy. This asymmetry also needs to be understood in the context of the political failure of the Opposition. A very different, more mature and silent coalition-making would be needed for such a change. The coalition that smartly christened itself as INDIA and momentarily upset theBJPby its naming game, has been on the verge of collapse even before elections are announced. One of its founders, the JD(U), has crossed over to the BJP yet again while others are busy cutting Congress to size. Any political party would naturally want to retain its base and expand it territorially. Therefore, seat sharing was bound to be a stumbling block in the way of an Opposition alliance. But the central political failure has been not to understand the long-term threat to their existence \u2014 in the process, ensuring a loss in the short term as well. This political failure is a common trait of Congress and its INDIA partners. As for Congress, even after a decade of decimation, it still houses enough self-seekers who do not mind joining the BJP. In a party system dominated disproportionately by one player, this is not surprising. What should nevertheless surprise us is the helplessness of Congress in not bringing in enough fresh blood during the past decade and allowing the dead wood to masquerade as its assets. Without consolidating itself internally, the party went on to waste its energies on building the Opposition alliance. Congress and its allies forget that it is not enough for them to individually bag more seats but they also need to ensure that the strength of the BJP is reduced. For that to happen, there are two preconditions. One, that they do not aspire at this moment to expand at each other\u2019s cost and that they keep the BJP in check in their respective areas of strength. In this, Congress seems to be the weak link. A casual look at the outcome of the 2019 elections is instructive: There are a little less than 150 Lok Sabha seats where Congress continues to be the main challenger to the BJP. This includes the central-northern-western states of MP,Chhattisgarh, Uttarakhand,HP, Rajasthan and Gujarat; it also includes Assam in the east and Karnataka (andGoa) in the south. Over time, smaller players are emerging in some of these states; the BSP and AAP have been trying to expand in some; but the bulk of the responsibility to halt the BJP will have to be with Congress in these states. The nominal existence of most other parties means that the coalition game has a marginal relevance here. The crucial question is whether Congress will improve its own performance. The results of 2019 are dismal from this point of view \u2014 out of the 144 seats here, Congress could win only a paltry eight. The reason lies in the huge surge in favour of the BJP. Although Congress was the \u201cchallenger\u201d in these states, except in Assam, it trailed the BJP by 10 percentage points at best (Chhattisgarh and Goa) to more than 30 per cent at worst (Gujarat, Himachal, Uttarakhand). So, one would have expected that in the past five years, Congress made an all-out effort to expand in states where it continues to matter but is being driven into a corner. To its credit, it has wrested back Himachal Pradesh. It has won Karnataka, but without reducing the vote share of the BJP. Its losses in the recently held Assembly elections in MP and Chhattisgarh do not inspire the confidence that it would bounce back. The inability of Congress to challenge the BJP in these more or less bipolar states invites new players to stake their claims. This poses a tough dilemma for the anti-BJP coalition. On the one hand, Congress would want a field clear of any other contestants so that it can hope to garner anti-BJP votes. But on the other hand, smaller parties in the coalition may believe that they have a better chance in some pockets and would want Congress to be magnanimous.Among the other states where Congress continued to have a sizeable presence till very recently, it has regained a foothold in Telangana. It is not clear whether it has organisationally rejuvenated itself sufficiently in Andhra Pradesh. In Maharashtra, the overall fragmentation of the polity apart, Congress has not taken advantage of the chaos. So, looking at the political battlegrounds, Congress continues to be a poor challenger where at the moment it is the only party that can take on the BJP. Instead, Congress keeps fighting the TMC in West Bengal over the latter\u2019s arrogance, keeps cribbing against the SP in UP where it ceded ground in the late \u201980s that it is still to regain even partially. At the same time, it is a moot question if state-level players will be able to halt the BJP without any help from friendly parties. This is not to say that these parties\u2019 concerns about their self-interest and expansion are not genuine. They will need to balance those interests with the need to work with each other. Right now, their expansion hinges on their ability to preserve themselves and their self-preservation is dependent on preservation of a minimal democratic framework \u2014 robust institutions and respect for rule of law are those basic pillars. Those opposed to the BJP must understand that these two conditions alone will allow them to function freely but they must respect these conditions themselves.Today, in India\u2019s most severe democratic crisis, electoral defeats won\u2019t count as political failure of the Opposition, but ignoring the tension between their larger ambition to expand and the responsibility to preserve democracy will surely be counted as a signal political failure.

"https://indianexpress.com/article/india/interim-unity-govt-common-voter-list-law-panel-report-simultaneous-polls-9187060/": {"source": "Indian Express", "headline": "Interim unity govt, common voter list: Law panel readies report on simultaneous polls", "content": "From making express provisions forsimultaneous polls, prescribing a common electoral roll to formation of a unity government in case a government falls before the end of its five-year tenure, the Law Commission of India has worked out three major Constitutional amendments to set the ball rolling for the \u2018One Nation, One Election\u2019 project in 2029, The Indian Express has learnt. The 22nd Law Commission, headed by former Karnataka High Court Chief Justice Ritu Raj Awasthi, is set to recommend the addition of a new chapter on simultaneous polls in the Constitution, sources said. Currently, Part XV of the Constitution deals with elections. It prescribes the role of the Election Commission and for elections to be based on adult suffrage among other aspects. The Commission is likely to recommend insertion of a new chapter, Part XVA, that would make provisions for simultaneous polls. While the law panel has not submitted its report to the government, it has made detailed presentations of its likely recommendations before the high-level committee, headed by former President Ram Nath Kovind, to \u201cexamine and make recommendations for holding simultaneous elections\u201d to Lok Sabha, state assemblies, municipalities\u00a0 and panchayats. In September last year,The Indian Expressreported that the Commission was mulling framing tentative timelines for simultaneous polls in 2024 and 2029. With 2024 elections round the corner, the recommendations will now be for 2029. The Commission\u2019s report is likely to suggest synchronising assembly elections in two stages in the next five years before all states can go to polls simultaneously with the next Lok Sabha elections in 2029. While the term of the Commission comes to an end in August, the government Tuesday appointed Justice Awasthi as one of the three judicial members of the Lokpal. Once he takes over as a Lokpal member, it is learnt that Justice Awasthi is likely to demit office as Chairperson of the law panel. Sources said, \u201cElections for states will have to be held collectively in two election cycles over the next five years. The term of some may have to be extended while it may have to be curtailed for others through the Constitutional amendment. Then 2029 can be the third election cycle where the Centre, all states, municipal and panchayat elections can be held together.\u201d One of the key concerns on simultaneous polls was tackling situations where the mandate results in a hung assembly or when a government falls midway when a no-confidence vote is instituted. Sources said that a second Constitutional amendment would deal with \u201csustainability of simultaneous polls\u201d which would address these concerns. It is learnt that the Law Commission\u2019s prescription is to first attempt setting up an all-party \u201cunity\u201d government if a government falls during its five-year tenure. \u201cIf that is not possible, then the alternative would be holding elections only for the term remaining before another cycle of simultaneous polls can be held,\u201d sources said. Contesting elections only to form a government for a short term, sources pointed out, could be a disincentive for political parties to bring down a government. \u201cThis is only a stop-gap measure to ensure that the cycle of simultaneous polls is not broken,\u201d sources said. The third Constitutional amendment to be recommended by the law panel would specifically deal with a common voter list. Currently in many states, the voter list for the panchayat and municipal elections is different from the one used for Parliament and assembly elections. While the State Election Commissions (SECs) supervise municipal and panchayat elections, the Election Commission conducts polls to the offices of the President and Vice President, and to Parliament, state assemblies and legislative councils. The idea of simultaneous polls, for long a BJP promise, has been amplified in recent years by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In its 2019 poll manifesto, the BJP said simultaneous polls were needed to reduce expenditure, ensure efficient utilisation of government resources and security forces and for effective policy planning. It said a common voter list will ensure every citizen gets the right to exercise his/her franchise for all public bodies.

who led team that rescued 41 from Uttarakhand tunnel", "content": "Three months ago, Vaqeel Hasan sported a proud smile as he returned home after his team of \u201crat-hole\u201d miners played a starring role in rescuing 41 workers who had been trapped for 17 days in thecollapsed Silkyara-Barkot tunnel in Uttarakhand. On Wednesday, he came home to find that it was being demolished as part of an anti-encroachment drive by theDelhiDevelopment Authority (DDA) at Sri Ram Colony in Northeast Delhi\u2019s Khajuri Khas area. \u201cThey (the authorities) came for demolition today morning; my wife and I were not at home, only my children were there. I rushed back, tried telling them not to go ahead, but they didn\u2019t listen,\u201d Hasan, 45, who also owns Rockwell Enterprises, the company that employed the \u201crat-hole\u201d miners, said. In an official statement, the DDA said, \u201cOn 28.02.2024, a demolition drive was conducted to remove encroachment from acquired land in village Khajuri Khas. The land was part of planned development land.\u201d Hasan claimed his house was the only one targeted in the locality. \u201cThere are other houses in the same line, it\u2019s a colony. They said it is DDA land. In the area, only my house was demolished. The registry is from 1987, and we have been living here since 2012. It is an 80 gaj plot,\u201d he said. Recalling the rescue mission in November, Hasan, the father of three minor children, said, \u201cWe didn\u2019t think about our lives and got the work done. We are not asking for money, all I ask for is that I have the house I was living in. Where do we go with the children?Kiraya dena humare bas ka hai nahi\u2026 doosra, ek dum se koi kiraye par makaan milega nahin(We can\u2019t pay rent, we also won\u2019t be able to find a place on rent immediately).\u201d Speaking toThe Indian Expressafter the rescue in November, Hasan had said: \u201cIn our team, there are both Hindus and Muslims, and people from both religions worked hard to save these 41 lives. None of them could have done this alone, and this is the message I want to give to everyone\u2026 We should all live in harmony and not spread the poison of hate. We all want to give our 100 per cent for the country\u2026 Please convey my message to everyone.\u201d Twelve people engaged with Hasan\u2019s company \u2014 six from Delhi including Hasan, and six from Bulandshahr \u2014 were credited with digging through 12 metres of debris during the last stretch to free the trapped miners. Weeks before the general elections, IE 100, the list of the 100 most powerful Indians this year, maps the lay of the land \u2014 the BJP holding strong, the Opposition trying to hold it together.

chasing the sarkari naukri", "content": "In some 40 years of teaching postgraduate students, discussions have always veered towards their aspirations. Invariably, all of them hope to get into some regular government employment. The certainty of having a wage through their entire working life seems to be most attractive to them. Associated with this are other unstated benefits of a government job, which come by way of access to good and cheap healthcare, subsidised housing and a belief that such a job provides access to power. The ones who could not land a government job often felt genuinely disheartened. Those who did get into government employment would complain that they were underpaid. To make sense of these moans and groans from the young, we checked out the details about earnings that are available in the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS). It has been carried out every year since 2017-18 and covers over 4,00,000 people in roughly 1,00,000 households. Just about 11 per cent earn enough to be able to pay income tax. Among those who do earn, about 57 per cent are self-employed, 21 per cent earn a wage or salary and 22 per cent earn episodically from casual labour. The number of those employed in government service is 9 per cent and 12 per cent are in private employment. The average income of a salaried employee in India is about Rs 20,000. The average income of someone self-employed is about Rs 13,347. Digging deeper into the data shows how this income varies across different income groups. Among the lowest three deciles of all earners, income from wage or salaried employment far outstrips income through self-employment. Similarly, among the big earners, the ones who are part of the top two decile of income earners in India, (once we exclude the outliers such as those earning more than Rs 8,00,000 per month), working in a salaried job brings in more income than does having a business. It is only in the two highly urbanised states ofDelhiandGoathat the self-employed earn more than the salaried. At the other end of the spectrum are small enclaves like Puducherry, Ladakh and the North Eastern states where salary earners make more money than the self-employed do. In other states, broadly speaking, in money terms, for the bottom deciles where monthly income is in the range of Rs 4,000 to Rs 10,000, the salary earners make more money than the self-employed do. For monthly incomes in the range of Rs 11,000 to Rs 25,000, the self-employed earn more. And for monthly incomes above Rs 25,000 in general, it is the salary earners who earn more money. States show significant variation in the numbers. Punjab, for instance, is the only state where the average earning for farmers is similar to others who are self-employed. The monthly middle income for farmers in Punjab (the value that divides the group into two halves) is Rs 15,000, which is the same as for others who are self-employed. However, in Punjab, traders earn more than farmers. For monthly incomes between Rs 4,000 to\u00a0Rs 22,000, the self-employed earn more money than wage/salary earners. For the lower deciles, both groups earn similar incomes which is also unique. In Tamil Nadu, for the lowest three deciles with incomes below Rs 14,000 per month and also for the highest three deciles with incomes more than Rs 22,000 per month, it is the salary earners who earn a higher income than the self-employed. For the middle four deciles, the self-employed earn more. The median income that divides the values for self-employed into two halves is Rs 15,500. The self-employed who are engaged in manufacturing activity, earn about 55 per cent of this, which is Rs 8,550. In most states, incomes for the self-employed in manufacturing are considerably lower than what the self-employed engaged in trade or construction earn. Are government salaries disproportionately high? What seems to make government service so attractive is the availability of various facilities for health, housing, education and transport. Everyone else, irrespective of their income level has to bear a disproportionately high cost to access analogous facilities. If the government were to provide equitable access to good and reliable facilities in education, health, housing and public transportation for all people at nominal rates or free of cost, it would go a long way to make self-employment an attractive option. After all, we already have the experience of how much the government helped people during Covid times when it provided free grain.

"headline": "India versus England: India\u2019s challenge to make rainy, chilly Dharamsala non-English", "content": "An extended winter, prediction of rain and natural conditions at the foothills of the Himalayas has made controlling the moisture level in the pitch a crucial factor for the fifth and final Test against England. Fast bowlers will get assistance if there is more moisture, something the ground staff are keeping an eye on as the plan is to roll out a pitch that will go the distance. It is understood that despite there being a nine-gap between the fourth and fifth Test, the pitch preparations for Dharamsala began almost a week before.The Indian Expressunderstands that the current climatic situation prevailing in the region made the BCCI and the HPCA to start work early. Although the overhead conditions and weather could make England a lot more at home than India, the 22 yards will be more to the liking of the hosts, said a source. \u201cIt all depends on moisture levels. If it is on the higher side, it would aid the seamers. And since the natural conditions would definitely bring more moisture, one needs to start the preparations early. Instead of starting it 10 days before the Test, the work began 15-20 days in advance. It will also give everyone a fair picture of how the pitch behaves and the ground staff can prepare accordingly. There could be movement because of overhead conditions, but there won\u2019t be seam movement off the pitch,\u201d sources in the know told The Indian Express. So far in this series, India have preferred to play on traditional slow pitches, which has offered turn as the Test progresses. However, India were unhappy with the conditions at Ranchi, where the ball began to keep low from Day 2, making it all the more challenging on the final day. Even though India have already sealed the series, a win here is essential as it would place them better in the WTC points percentage. At present India are in the second spot and have three more series \u2013 Bangladesh, New Zealand and Australia \u2013 coming up after this. So despite sealing a series win, India are keen on a 4-1 scoreline and are not willing to take any chances with the pitch. The weather is a major factor. As per the forecast, in the lead up to the Test, the city\u2019s day time temperatures are expected to touch only 15 degree Celsius, with the night temperatures around 7 degree Celsius. With forecasts of rain also in store \u2013 especially during the match-days. It is understood that despite the weather, the only chance of Dharamsala having a green track for the Test is if something goes wrong during the pitch preparations. And according to those in the know, since the pitch is also made of black soil content, making a slow surface will not be an issue. But the amount of moisture the pitch retains will be key. AtHyderabadand Vizag, with Tests being played towards the end of winter, because of the dew and fog, there was good moisture content in the first session. And with the afternoon sun being harsh, on India\u2019s request, the ground staff used only the sack cloth instead of tarpaulin to cover the pitch so that the moisture evaporates and to prevent sweating. At Dharamsala, with the moisture likely to last longer because of the low temperature levels, extra attention is being given to the amount of watering. If it is on the higher side, then the ground staff would stop watering it as they don\u2019t need to worry about the pitch breaking apart. \u201cSince it is going to remain cold, one need not worry about it crumbling under the sun and the cracks opening up. For all you know, in the lead up to the Test, if the temperatures remain the same (13-15 degree C) then the ground staff can also let the pitch bake under the sun and let the moisture levels decrease,\u201d the official said.

at the United Nations on Wednesday, adding that New Delhi cannot pay attention to \u201ca country that speaks while being soaked in red.\u201d India made the statement while exercising its \u2018Right of Reply\u2019 to Pakistan\u2019s comments on NewDelhiat the High-Level Segment of the 55th Regular Session of theUN Human Rights Council. First Secretary Anupama Singh, speaking at the session, said, \u201cWith regard to the extensive references to India made by Pakistan, we note that it is deeply unfortunate for the Council\u2019s platform to have once again been misused to make patently false allegations against India.\u201d India exercises Right of Reply against Pakistan at#HRC55pic.twitter.com/rdTMVWYmFT \u2014 India at UN, Geneva (@IndiaUNGeneva)February 28, 2024 \u201cThe entire Union Territories ofJammuand Kashmir and Ladakh is an integral and inalienable part of India, and the constitutional measures taken by the Government of India to ensure socio-economic development and good governance in the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir are matters internal to India. Pakistan has no locus standi to pronounce on matters that are internal to India,\u201d she added. Criticising Pakistan\u2019s human rights record, Singh said, \u201cA country that has institutionalised the systemic persecution of its own minorities and has a truly abysmal human rights record, commenting on India, which is demonstrably making great strides in achieving economic progress and social justice, is not merely ironical but perverse.\u201d https://t.co/t71D1zDzzXpic.twitter.com/qFSEC3KyXH \u2014 India at UN, Geneva (@IndiaUNGeneva)February 28, 2024 She referred to instances of violence against Christian Pakistanis last year and Islamabad\u2019s alleged support of terrorism. \u201cA glaring example was the large scale brutality perpetrated against the minority Christian community in Jaranwala city, Pakistan in August 2023, when 19 churches were gutted and 89 Christian houses burnt down. Three, a country that hosts and even celebrates UNSC-sanctioned terrorists, commenting on India whose pluralistic ethos and democratic credentials are exemplars for the world, is a contrast for everyone to see,\u201d she said. \u201cWe cannot pay any further attention to a country that speaks while being soaked in red\u2026 the red of the bloodshed from the terrorism it sponsors around the world; the red of its debt-riddled national balance sheets; and the red of the shame its own people feel for their government having failed to serve their actual interests,\u201d Singh added. The 55th Regular Session of the UN Human Rights Council is taking place from February 26-April 5. India and Pakistan have often locked horns over issues like Jammu and Kashmir, human rights records, and more. Weeks before the general elections, IE 100, the list of the 100 most powerful Indians this year, maps the lay of the land \u2014 the BJP holding strong, the Opposition trying to hold it together.

"INDIA singed by UP Rajya Sabha test, SP to rejig Lok Sabha game plan, Congress worry grows over Amethi, Raebareli", "content": "While theoutcome of the elections to the 10 Rajya Sabha seats in Uttar PradeshTuesday dealt a blow to the Samajwadi Party (SP), it also has ramifications for the Opposition INDIA alliance just ahead of the upcoming Lok Sabha polls. TheBJPbagged eight of these 10 seats as against the SP\u2019s two, even though theAkhilesh Yadav-led party was poised to win three seats based on the number of its legislators. The BJP managed to get its eighth nominee, industrialist Sanjay Seth, elected while the SP\u2019s third candidate, ex-bureaucrat Alok Ranjan, lost as seven of the SP MLAs cross-voted. The Upper House polls were billed as the first litmus test for the INDIA bloc, whose constituents in the state now include the SP and the Congress. After the setback that the SP got, some of the alliance leaders fear that it may even impact the allies\u2019 prospects in some key \u201cwinnable\u201d seats in the Lok Sabha polls. TheRajya Sabhapoll results also saw the Congress training its guns on the BSP, which it had been avoiding so far in a bid to woo the party into the INDIA fold. State Congress president Ajay Rai said, \u201cThe way lone BSP MLA (Uma Shankar Singh) voted for BJP in Rajya Sabha polls has made the intentions of BSP clear that it is working as B-team of BJP.\u201d He pointed out that both Congress MLAs, Aradhana Mishra and Virendra Chaudhary, voted for the SP\u2019s candidates. The Congress camp also expressed surprise that the SP was caught off-guard even as Akhilesh\u2019s trusted faces like the SP\u2019s chief whip Manoj Pandey quit while the polling was still underway. Of the SP MLAs who cross-voted in favour of the BJP candidates, Manoj Pandey represents the Unchahar Assembly segment of the Raebareli Lok Sabha seat, while Rakesh Pratap Singh represents the Gauriganj Assembly seat in the Amethi parliamentary constituency. Also, Maharaji Prajapati, wife of former SP minister Gayatri Prajapati, who is an SP MLA from the Amethi Assembly constituency, skipped voting. Raebareli and Amethi are among the few remaining strongholds of the Congress in UP. In the 2019 polls,Rahul Gandhilost from Amethi to the BJP\u2019s Smriti Irani, whileSonia Gandhiretained her Raebareli seat. Sonia has now bid farewell to electoral politics and her Raebareli seat, choosing to get elected to the Rajya Sabha from Rajasthan. She is likely to be replaced by Priyanka, her daughter, as the Congress candidate from Raebareli. The presence of \u201crebel\u201d SP faces in Raebareli and Amethi has spooked the Congress, which is going to review its poll plans for these \u201cseats of significance\u201d, a party leader said. The ruling BJP claims that senior party leaders like Daya Shankar Singh, Deputy CM Brijesh Pathak and parliamentary affairs minister Suresh Khanna were in touch with the rebel SP legislators. Of Raebareli\u2019s five Assembly segments, the SP had won four \u2014 Bacharawan, Harchandpur, Sareni and Unchahar \u2014 in the 2022 Assembly polls. Only the Raebareli Sadar seat was won by the BJP which had given its ticket to then Congress rebel Aditi Singh. Even without an alliance, the SP used to leave Amethi and Raebareli seats for the Congress in the previous polls. With the two parties now sealing a seat-sharing deal \u2013 under which the SP gave the Congress 17 seats, including Raebareli and Amethi, out of the state\u2019s 80 seats \u2013 the grand old party expected proactive support from the local SP MLAs in these constituencies. For the SP, the Upper House poll outcome has thrown up a larger challenge as it needs to urgently set its house in order. The eight \u2018rebel\u2019 SP MLAs include three Brahmin faces, two Thakur leaders, two from the backward communities and one Dalit leader. The party is expected to recalibrate its strategies for the Lok Sabha polls, which are barely one-and-a-half months away. Asked about the alliance\u2019s road map in the wake of the Rajya Sabha polls, Ajay Rai told The India Express, \u201cThe Congress followed the alliance dharma as our both MLAs voted for the SP candidates, but it is for SP to see what went wrong.\u201d Weeks before the general elections, IE 100, the list of the 100 most powerful Indians this year, maps the lay of the land \u2014 the BJP holding strong, the Opposition trying to hold it together.

Express", "headline": "Dune Part Two movie review: Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Zendaya return in a stunning exemplar of cinema\u2019s imagination", "content": "There has been much discussion over the years into the politics of the Dune books. Do they excoriate the cult of the hero, or do they only seem to do so, even as a \u201csuperior\u201d race proves the bravest of the brave? It\u2019s not easy to walk this thin line in a blockbuster of the audaciousscale that Denis Villeneuvehas mounted to bring the books to the big screen. Part Two \u2013 two long years after the first Dune \u2013 is where he gives this a shot. Part Two is bigger, bolder and more beautiful; its vistas of shimmering sands and chilly shadows (cinematographer Greig Fraser again) creating an impossibly perfect setting for a story that can never settle down for one thing. Chalamet\u2019s Paul Atreides is that perfect putty too, to mould and behold. One has to doff one\u2019s hat to Villeneuve for not taking his eyes off that transition of Paul, from a boy to a man-boy, to a man who pushes that boy deep down as he becomes a \u201cMessiah\u201d. Is it the screenwriter-director\u2019s fault then that the stuff around is just too spectacular as to overwhelm these little details? It was the dilemma that the Frank Herbert novels also jostled with, and Villeneuve has it worse given the format, the expectations, the anticipation, thebudget, the stars and the template he set himself with his first Dune. In all respects, Part Two is a superior effort, an exemplar of cinema\u2019s imagination and possibilities, from the grandeur of its landscapes to the intimacy of its characters. There is more of the latter in Part Two as Paul finally meets and gets to spend extended, quiet moments with Chani (Zendaya), the woman he has literally been dreaming about (but with a love that is surprisingly passion-less, unlike the film it inhabits). He also sees his mother, the psychic Jessica (Ferguson), part of a band of the mysterious Bene Gesserits, changing into someone he doesn\u2019t recognise as she scents the prospect of a new future for him and herself. There is the warm Stilgard (Bardem), a leader of the Fremens, who is determined in his belief, and in his efforts to convince others, that Paul is Lisan al-Gaib, the Messiah prophesied to \u201clead us to Paradise\u201d \u2013 where \u201cwater falls from the sky\u201d, for one, and is not extracted out of even dead bodies, to not let a single drop go waste. Stilgart\u2019s training of Paul (who comes from an ocean planet) to survive their desert planet, to spot and then control, and then ride, the dangerous sandworms that lie under its shifting, endless sands, is exhilarating. Other characters come and go, including Skarsg\u00e5rd as the Baron Harkonnen, whose corpulence stands in for his bottomless greed; Bautista as his nephew Rabban, still trying to control the Fremen; Butler as the other, charismatic nephew Feyd-Rautha, who has built a reputation for brute cruelty in super quick time; Walken as the Emperor of the Imperium, who has compromised his position after pitting one Great House against another; Pugh as his daughter Princess Irulan, who clearly will have more of a role next time; and Brolin as Gurney Helleck and a father figure to Paul. That is not counting Anya Taylor-Joy, who is as yet just a foetus in Jessica\u2019s womb, and already asserting herself by talking to both her mother and brother Paul. Evidently, Villeneuve does not have it easy as he weaves these characters into this story of inter-planetary ambitions, wars of dominance, disparate worlds, and countless battles, involving everything from atomic warheads and artillery, to gladiatorial duels and hand-to-hand combats.   A post shared by DUNE (@dunemovie) He has already shown a flair for this more than once in his previous films, including Dune, Blade Runner 2049 and Arrival. And while the spectacles and blood lust \u2013 and, oh, those sandworms \u2013 threaten to run away with Dune: Part Two, and the film has less time for exploration of the interior worlds of women, Villeneuve pauses to bravely ask us to look at not just the Messiah but also the little men and women looking up at him. They dress in robes reminiscent of Arabia, their warriors are called fedaykin, their Messaih is named Muad\u2019Dib, they talk of the \u201cfundamentalists\u201d among them, they are bombed from the skies, and they take refuge \u2013 including bloodied women and children \u2013 in makeshift shelters. Meanwhile, the war waged by the powers-that-be doesn\u2019t stop. Princess Irulan ponders about the hold of religious belief, how \u201crepression will only help it flourish\u201d, and the need to let Prophets be because \u201ca dead Prophet is more powerful\u201d. Hence, the Emperor\u2019s strategy: \u201cLet war happen, and then we come in to bring peace.\u201d   A post shared by Warner Bros. UK (@warnerbrosuk) Above all, as Chalamet finally grows up in his role \u2013 though without acquiring an extra sinew of muscle or facial hair \u2013 Villeneuve gives us glimpses of how power can corrupt even the purest of souls. As Paul barks \u201csilence\u201d and commands loyalty, as Chani fears her love has changed like she feared it would, you can see that corruption taking hold.

supplements raising the risk of heart attack in people with diabetes?", "content": "Can your calcium supplements be hurting you? Long-term use of calcium supplements in those with diabetes can increase the risk of heart disease and deaths due to it, shows a recent study based on data of over 400,000 people from the UK biobank. It shows how habitually taking calcium may increase the risk of death due to cardiovascular events by nearly 60 per cent among those with diabetes. While the study did not find an increase in risk for those who did not have diabetes, Dr V Mohan, Dr Mohan\u2019s Diabetes Specialities Centre,Chennai, warns people against consuming calcium \u2014 or any other supplements \u2014 without the prescription from a doctor. \u201cMy professor used to say that expensive supplements lead to the urine becoming more expensive, which was to say that they do not have any benefits unless medically needed. Now, we are seeing the harms of taking supplements such as calcium. People must not take supplements unnecessarily,\u201d he said. While the mechanism of action is not fully understood, Dr Mohan says that the theory is that excess calcium \u2014 from supplements taken over a long period when not needed \u2014 gets deposited in the vessels of the heart. \u201cIn fact, coronary artery calcium is considered to be one of the key markers to see how healthy one\u2019s heart is,\u201d said Dr Mohan. He said that the higher risk among people with diabetes \u2014 as shown in the study \u2014 could be owing to the fact that they anyway have a higher risk of cardiovascular diseases. No, if it has not been prescribed for a particular condition. Several over-the-counter calcium tablets are marketed for post-menopausal women to prevent fractures as they start losing bone density. Dr Mohan says one should only take it if it has been prescribed after a bone mineral density test. \u201cYou see, oestrogen has a protective effect on the heart leading to lower risk of heart diseases in women before menopause. However, after menopause as the oestrogen levels decline they have the same risk as men of getting heart diseases. So, calcium supplements should not be taken at this age if not needed,\u201d said Dr Mohan. Only on prescription. Calcium supplements may be required during pregnancy and lactation, by those who are lactose intolerant and cannot have milk and those who have digestive diseases that decrease the ability of the body to absorb calcium. \u201cAs much as possible, calcium \u2014 as well as other supplements \u2014 should be consumed through foods. In the natural form, it\u2019s not really harmful,\u201d said Dr Mohan. Dr Mohan says men and women can get their daily recommended intake of calcium just through milk. \u201cOne glass of milk has nearly 500 mg of calcium and should be sufficient,\u201d he said. Other than that calcium can be found in other dairy products such as cheese, green or leafy vegetables such as kale and okra, soya, and fish that can be consumed with the bones.

Revenue Service officerSameer Wankhede, who is under the scanner for several alleged financial and procedural irregularities, addressed the interactions that he is said to have had with actor Shah Rukh Khan. Wankhede led the team that arrested Shah Rukh\u2019s son, Aryan Khan, on drug-related charges in 2021. Aryan spent nearly a month in jail before being released on bail. In a new interview with The Lallantop, Wankhede described this as \u2018the smallest case of (his) life\u2019, and claimed to not be familiar with Shah Rukh\u2019s popularity. He also said that he has absolutely \u2018no regrets\u2019 about anything in his life, and given the chance to return to his post \u2013 he is currently on trial for allegedly extorting money from Shah Rukh, and forlaundering money\u2013 he \u2018would do it all again\u2019. The interviewer asked, \u201cIs this a warning to Shah Rukh Khan?\u201d Wankhede replied in Hindi, \u201cNo, I\u2019m a small man. Who am I to warn anybody? The person that you are referring to, I don\u2019t even watch very many movies, I don\u2019t know the names\u2026\u201d The interviewer countered, \u201cAre you telling me that you are not aware of the stardom of Shah Rukh Khan?\u201d Wankhede replied, \u201cI would prefer if you ask me about \u2018real heroes\u2019 such as Modi ji, or Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.\u201d During the proceedings against Wankhede,alleged chats between him and Shah Rukhwere leaked publicly. In one of these messages, Shah Rukh appeared to be imploring Wankhede to show mercy on Aryan. \u201cI beg you as a father,\u201d Shah Rukh allegedly wrote, \u201cPlease don\u2019t let him be in that jail. He will break as a human being.\u201d Asked about these alleged chats, Wankhede said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about this man, but whenever you take action (in cases like this), and parents reach out to you, you feel bad about it. Especially when the person is a consumer, or if they have a drug habit. First and foremost, you feel bad, and you want them to go to rehab. Unless, of course, we\u2019re talking about hardened gangsters.\u201d He continued, \u201cWe once nabbed a lady peddler who had little children. She didn\u2019t have money for milk also. You definitely feel bad. But at the end of the day, it\u2019s your duty to recover drugs.\u201d Wankhede said that it was very common, during his tenure as the Zonal Director for the Narcotics Control Bureau, for him to be \u2018approached by hundreds of mothers\u2019, and he considered it his duty to counsel them. Asked why he didn\u2019t disclosehis personal interactions with Shah Rukhto his NCB higher-ups, he refused to get into details, and said that he has already given his response to the High Court. Wankhede also found time for some humour, when a journalist named Aryan asked him a question. \u201cWhich Aryan?\u201d he joked. \u201cYou haven\u2019t lost your sense of humour,\u201d the interviewer remarked, and Wankhede said, \u201cI don\u2019t have any regrets in life, firstly, and if given the chance, I\u2019d do it all again.\u201d Wankhede\u2019s tenure with the NCB ended shortly after he was removed from the Aryan Khan case. Aryan himself was given a clean chit in 2022. Click for more updates and latestBollywood newsalong withEntertainment updates.

again!", "content": "Every year, in the non-leap years, I\u2019m asked, \u201cSo when do you celebrate your birthday?\u201d or \u201cHow old are you actually?\u201d The answer to the second question is that I\u2019m actually turning 13 \u2014 an official teenager \u2014 in leap years (or 52, but that\u2019s not as exciting!). It\u2019s definitely fun. My 11-year-old nephew, for instance, is waiting for when he gets \u201colder\u201d than me. I recently joined The Honour Society of Leap Year Day Babies, aFacebookgroup that had its origins offline in the US, founded in 1988 by \u2018Leap Day Lady\u2019 Raenell Dawn (who turns 16 in leap years this year). It\u2019s a lively group, with many delighted to come across others who share the same birthdate, with one frequently asked question \u2014 \u201cWhy are my friends asking if I can celebrate on the weekend, when it\u2019s my actual birthday after four years?\u201d I can relate to the indignation as, this year, any celebrations simply must be on the Thursday that February 29 falls on. This year, as I turn 13 \u2014 again \u2014 I also decided to consider how young I really feel. Maturity or immaturity is not really a measure of age, but I would love to go back to a time when it felt like I had all the answers. Lately, all I seem to have are questions. There are some obvious ones, such as pondering over retirement plans, health insurance (not sure when most conversations started quickly veering towards health) and, of course, dreaming of vacation homes by the beach. There\u2019s also the looming reality of jobs drying up as one, ironically, gains in experience. Frustrating, yes, but also strangely liberating. Maybe we can finally stop pretending that our professional lives rock our worlds. It\u2019s a great opportunity to pivot to doing something we love, but first, we have to discover what that may be. What did the teen me, or us, dream of doing when we grew up? Read some books, see the world, gain some new experiences. Here\u2019s a chance at a do-over as the world gives us pause. At 40, 50, even 60 or later, I see people who are still prolific and leading active lives, whether it\u2019s educators, lawyers, counsellors, yoga teachers or writers and researchers. A friend is pursuing a law degree in his forties and loving it, while someone else may be toying with the idea of a homestay in the mountains. Fortunately, there is a course to prepare one for everything these days, whether it\u2019s AI or astrology. However, while the mind roams unfettered, there are still bills to be paid! And while the younger me would be ready to walk out of a job on a matter of principle, my present day version relates more to a character in the movie \u2018Good Grief\u2019. To quote, \u201cI stopped liking my job, but I keep working because it pays well. And that makes me feel sick. But not sick enough to quit. Which makes me feel even more sick.\u201d Did our younger versions have more integrity? While that\u2019s a loaded question to ponder, we were definitely more spontaneous. A WhatsApp status hit home recently, \u201cDon\u2019t ask me if you can call; just call!\u201d So maybe we can start by doing that? Or schedule spontaneity, like do something without planning on Saturday, 11 am or something! Let\u2019s retrace our steps to when we were young and carefree and rewire our brains to when we didn\u2019t overthink and calculate our every move. As for my leap year birthday, for the first time in four years, I won\u2019t be asked if I want to be wished on February 28 or March 1. A valid question, I realise, as many in the online group consider themselves staunch \u201cFebruarians\u201d and celebrate on the 28th, while I prefer to celebrate the day after. For all practical purposes, though, most of us end up celebrating or getting wished on both days! As for some leap year trivia, during a conversation, Raenell shared that a lady born in 1896 didn\u2019t turn \u201cone\u201d till 1904 when she turned eight as 1900 was not a leap year (not divisible by 4), while a Sri Lankan professor has O\u2019Leap as his middle name. There are Leap Day Babies within families, born across three or more generations. There is also the case of twin \u201cleaplings\u201d where one was born before midnight on the 28th and the other on, you guessed it, 29th! The song 2/29 by Rookie Card is considered a leap year anthem and this year, the band has made a video of \u201cleapers\u201d around the world lip-syncing to the lyrics. The takeaway, as Raenell remarked is, \u201cIt\u2019s a bonus day for everyone.\u201d It\u2019s an extra day\u2026so make it count! (The writer is a journalist and Mindset Coach.

{"source": "Indian Express", "headline": "Transforming India\u2019s Retail Payments! RAZORPAY Launches Country\u2019s First UPI-Led QR Stack for Enterprises at FTX\u201924", "content": "From the local tea stall to the neighborhoodkirana, QR codes have revolutionized the way we pay, simplifying transactions for vendors and customers alike. India has 27 Mn Static QR (SQR) stickers and more than 10 Mn SQR soundboxes deployed. No wonder our streets are filled with QRs all around us! Yet, amidst this digital revolution, there\u2019s a missing link in the chain: organized retail. 80% of in-store payments happen via QR, however, out of this, only 2% is from organized retail. In organized retail stores, traditional QR codes in POS devices aren\u2019t user-friendly, leading to longer transaction times and queues at the checkout counter. Identifying the Challenge Most of us have been there when we are at our favourite retail store, eagerly awaiting our turn at the checkout counter. As we inch closer to the cashier, we notice the familiar sight of card machines and cash registers, but something seems amiss. Despite the convenience of QR payments, organized stores still rely on traditional card machines, making the payment process slow and leaving customers and cashiers frustrated with long queues and cumbersome transactions.\u00a0 Additionally, SQR (Static QR) devices require frequent servicing and cashiers need to do reconciliation manually, leading to leakages! On the other hand, as a buyer, we can see so many QRs in small unorganised retail shops, and when we go to a large format retail store in our neighbourhood mall, we are expected to make payment on a traditional Cards-first PoS which gives a very inferior payment experience. The real reason is that most PoS devices in India are tailored for debit and credit card customers and QR traditionally has been built for unorganised retail today. This disconnect underscores a critical challenge in organized retail: the need for seamless, user-friendly payment solutions. There is no denying that we all crave simplicity and speed, while retailers seek efficient queue management and versatile payment options to enhance the shopping experience.

"Indian Express", "headline": "Did Morarji Desai really drink his own urine?", "content": "When it comes toformer Prime Minister Morarji Desai,two pieces of information remain most popularly known. First is that he was born on a leap day (February 29, 1896) \u2014 he would go on to celebrate less than 25 birthdays at the time of his death in 1995. Second, is that he would consume his urine, which eventually took on the popular sobriquet of \u2018Morarji Cola\u2019. A subject of jokes aplenty as well as serious discussion in certain circles, the story of \u2018Morarji Cola\u2019 today holds near-mythical status. But is it really true? Or is the story of \u2018Morarji Cola\u2019 just another urban legend that has been willed into existence by sheer repetition? The year was 1978. India\u2019s first non-Congress government was in power, helmed by Morarji Desai. Over 80 years old at the time, Desai had waited for over a decade to occupy the prime minister\u2019s office \u2014 he was a strong contender to succeed Lal Bahadur Shastri in 1966, only to be pipped by a relative novice named Indira Gandhi. And After Indira\u2019s over-decade-long rule (including nearly two years of Emergency, from\u00a0 1975 to 1977), Desai promised to usher in some major changes. Notable among these was undoing India\u2019s pro-Soviet tilt, which became especially strong after the signing of the Indo-Soviet Treaty in 1971. Desai sought to mend India\u2019s then-strained relations with the United States. In January 1978, US President Jimmy Carter visited India, and in June, Desai landed up stateside. But instead of his statesmanship and the situation of the Janata Party in India, Desai\u2019s US visit is most remembered for something else. Morarji Desai, during the visit, sat for an interview with journalist Dan Rather forCBS\u2019s weekly news magazine60 Minutes.During the interview, Desai told a rather stunned Dan Rather about his proclivity to partake in urine. Rather asked Desai about the secret behind his spritely health at the age of 82, to which Desai responded by saying that his diet consisted of fruit and vegetable juices, fresh and natural milk, plain yoghurt, honey, fresh fruits, raw nuts, five cloves of garlic every day. \u201cAnd I drink five to eight ounces of urine every morning on an empty stomach,\u201d he added. \u201cYack! You drink your urine? That is the most repulsive thing I have ever heard,\u201d Rather retorted. Desai, however, was unperturbed, and described drinking urine as a \u201cnatural treatment\u201d. He said: \u201cIf you observe the animals, you will see that they drink their urine to stay fit \u2026 In my country mothers used to give babies their own urine when they were suffering from stomach ache. And in the Hindu philosophy \u2026 Cow\u2019s urine has been considered holy, and it is prescribed in every ceremony. People must drink it.\u201d In fact, Desai went on to talk about how American scientists were preparing urine extracts for heart trouble. \u201cSo your people are drinking other people\u2019s urine but not their own. And it costs dollars, thousands of dollars, while theirs [their own] is free and more effective,\u201d he said. He concluded by telling Dan Rather about the virtues of drinking one\u2019s own urine. \u201cIf you drink all your urine, in just a few days the body becomes purified. By the third day your urine is without any colour or any smell or any taste and it will be pure almost like water. You will feel very good because your system is improved and cleansed considerably,\u201d Desai said. He added: \u201cDrinking urine fights the cause of all diseases, and it costs you nothing.\u201d Weeks before the general elections, IE 100, the list of the 100 most powerful Indians this year, maps the lay of the land \u2014 the BJP holding strong, the Opposition trying to hold it together.

observed mating for the first time. Both are males", "content": "Researchers have, for the first time observed and captured images of humpback whales having sex. And as it turns out, both the individuals involved in the act were male. If you are surprised that animals also engage in homosexuality, you really shouldn\u2019t be. The 1999 bookBiological Exuberanceby Bruce Bagemihl features well-illustrated and meticulously researched instances of homosexuality in the wild. So, the argument that being gay is \u201cunnatural\u201d has not held water for a long time. Scientists have spent decades researching humpback whales, but even sightings of a male penis, have been rare, according toThe Guardian. Even sexual intercourse has not been documented until recently when two photographers captured such an encounter between two whales off the coast of Hawaii. The sighting happened in January 2022, and it has been confirmed in astudy published in the journalMarine Mammal Scienceon Tuesday. Two whales approached and circled a boat in the waters off the island of Maui before engaging in sexual intercourse. \u201cUpon reviewing the photographs, it was noticed that Whale A had a significant jaw injury, that likely impaired normal feeding behavior. It was also observed that Whale B had its penis extruded throughout the entire encounter and, at times, would penetrate the genital opening of Whale A, using its pectoral fins to hold Whale A. This grasping behavior appears to be an important component of copulation or attempted copulation for humpback whales,\u201d wrote the researchers in the study. Such non-productive sexual behaviour could happen for vari0ous reasons \u2014 it can simply be practice for future encounters or it could play an important role in establishing and maintaining relationships between individuals. It could also be used as a tool to assert dominance over other individuals. Robert Pitman, a marine ecologist at the Mammal Institute at Oregon State University put forward a simpler and more morbid explanation to National Geographic \u2014 When adult males are in breeding grounds they are focused on mating and might try their luck with other males. While some would respond aggressively, others won\u2019t, especially when they are sick. Pitman was not involved in the study. Whale A in this example seems to be particularly sick, in part due to the jaw injury. It also seemed to be hosting a large number of parasites.

Kanpur alumnus donates $2,50,000 to establish endowed programs in Chemical Engineering department", "content": "The Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur (IITK) alumnus Dr Rajeev Gautam has contributed $250,000 to establish three endowed programs in the Department of Chemical Engineering. The development comes as part of a tripartite Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed between IITK, IIT Kanpur Foundation, and Dr Gautam. The sum would be utilised towards the institution of an endowed faculty chair, a faculty fellowship and a travel grant program for students. Prof S Ganesh, Director, IIT Kanpur, said, \u201cWe are grateful to Dr Rajeev Gautam for his generous support to his alma mater. I am sure these programs will further strengthen the academic and research activities at the Chemical Engineering Department by empowering emerging researchers.\u201d The endowed programs supported under the donation \u2014 Om Prakash Gautam Endowed Faculty Chair, the Rajeev and Joyce Gautam Faculty Fellowship, and the Rajeev and Joyce Gautam Travel Grant for students, reflect Dr Gautam\u2019s commitment to nurturing future leaders in the field of Chemical Engineering. Dr Rajeev Gautam, commenting on the significance of the endowed programs, stated: \u201cIt brings me immense pride to be able to give back to my alma mater in whichever possible ways to promote research and academic excellence. The Department of Chemical Engineering provided me with resources to set a strong technical foundation for my professional journey and success. I hope that the endowed programs empower the next generation of changemakers in the field of Chemical Engineering.\u201d After graduating in Chemical Engineering from IITK in 1974, Dr Gautam played a key role in the creation and introduction of various catalytic and separations applications for the refining, petrochemical, and gas processing sectors. Spanning a four-decade-long stint with Honeywell, Dr Gautam retired as President Emeritus, Honeywell Performance Materials and Technologies. Recognizing his extensive work in the field, IIT Kanpur honoured Dr Gautam with the Distinguished Alumnus Award in 2020.

"Pakistan\u2019s newly-elected National Assembly begins inaugural session", "content": "Pakistan\u2019s newly-elected Parliament on Thursday began its maiden session after President Dr Arif Alvi finally summoned the Assembly following differences with the caretaker government over the issue of former prime minister Imran Khan\u2019s party-backed candidates being allotted the reserved seats. The opening session, headed by outgoing Speaker of the previous Parliament, Raja Pervaiz Ashraf, began after a delay of more than an hour. Early on Thursday, Alvi approved a move from the caretaker parliamentary affairs ministry to summon the newly-elected National Assembly\u2019s first session on February 29, according to a statement posted by the president\u2019s X account. \u201cSubject to some reservations, President Dr Arif Alvi has summoned to convene the National Assembly on February 29 in exercise of the powers conferred by Article 54(1) of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan,\u201d the statement said. It said that the president accorded his approval keeping in view \u201cthe mandate and implications of the timeline given in Article 91 (2) and subject to some reservations and expecting the resolution of the issue of the reserved seats before the 21st day [after the general elections].\u201d The late-night statement also took issue with the tone of the summary sent to Alvi by the caretaker Prime Minister Anwaar-ul-Haq Kakar, adding that the president was calling the session as he expected that the issue of reserved seats would be settled by the 21st day after the polls, as envisaged in the law. According to constitutional provisions, the meeting of the National Assembly must be convened within 21 days of the elections, and February 29 is the mandated date under Article 91. The newly elected Parliament commenced its maiden session on Thursday amidst a row over the alleged rigging of votes. In the opening session, Ashraf will administer the oath to the new members and adjourn the session for the next Assembly to elect the new speaker and deputy speaker. The election for the post of prime minister is expected on Saturday, and former premierShehbaz Sharifis poised to be elected as the new leader of the House. On Monday, Alvi, a close aide of jailed former prime ministerImran Khanand a former senior member of his party, rejected a move from the caretaker parliamentary affairs ministry to summon the National Assembly\u2019s first session, maintaining that all reserved seats be allocated before its summoning. Winning independent candidates of 71-year-old former-cricketer-turned-politician Khan\u2019s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) joined the rightwing Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) to receive the party\u2019s share of reserved seats for women and minorities in the national and provincial assemblies. Candidates of the PTI fought as independents after the party could not directly participate in the February 8 elections due to the non-allotment of its iconic electoral symbol \u2013 the cricket bat. A five-member bench of the Election Commission of Pakistan held an open hearing on the SIC\u2019s plea seeking allocation of reserved seats and the counter-pleas filed against it earlier this week. The House was already meeting at 10 am on Thursday as National Assembly outgoing Speaker Ashraf decided to convene the lower house of parliament session after Alvi\u2019s denial. Alvi\u2019s statement said that returning the move for a National Assembly session was \u201cvery much in accordance with the provisions of Article 48(1)\u201d of the Constitution. \u201cIt is not understood on what grounds it has been taken as a partisan act, though it was also aimed at the completion of the National Assembly in accordance with Article 51 of the Constitution,\u201d it said. Alvi\u2019s decision not to summon the session was heavily criticised by the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party and the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), whose leaders on Tuesday warned that it might lead to \u201clegal consequences\u201d. The maiden session of the National Assembly is expected to be explosive as the PTI alleged massive rigging in the election and vowed to raise their voice inside and outside the Parliament. The PTI-backed independents won majority seats at the 266-member National Assembly in the February 8 general election. However, the PML-N and the PPP have agreed on a power-sharing deal to form a new coalition government, which may effectively end Khan\u2019s chances of returning to power. Khan\u2019s party has rejected the attempts by the PML-N and the PPP to form a coalition government, warning that robbing its public endorsement by the \u201cmandate thieves\u201d will result in the worst political instability. Independent candidates \u2014 a majority backed by the PTI party \u2014 won 93 National Assembly seats. The PML-N won 75 seats, while the PPP came third with 54 seats. The Muttahida Qaumi Movement Pakistan (MQM-P) has 17 seats. Weeks before the general elections, IE 100, the list of the 100 most powerful Indians this year, maps the lay of the land \u2014 the BJP holding strong, the Opposition trying to hold it together.

{"source": "Indian Express", "headline": "A Siddaramaiah-D K Shivakumar show: How Congress managed to keep BJP, JD(S) at bay in Karnataka", "content": "When the Janata Dal (Secular) announced the candidature of a multi-millionaire in Karnataka for the Rajya Sabha polls in early February despite having only 19 MLAs in hand \u2014 in a situation where 45 votes were needed \u2014 it was apparent that the JD(S) would be attempting to pull off an impossible win by teaming up with its alliance partner BJP, which had around 20 votes to spare. There was confidence in the ranks of the JD(S) andBJPleadership that the impossible could be pulled off by exploiting chinks in the Congress fold like the divisions that exist between factions allied to Chief MinisterSiddaramaiahand Deputy CM D K Shivakumar. \u201cSomebody will have to take responsibility for ensuring that cross-voting does not happen. It is a good time for dissatisfied MLAs to profit,\u201d a senior BJP leader said after JD(S) candidate D Kupendra Reddy, a formerRajya SabhaMP, filed his nomination. In the end, unlike Himachal Pradesh where the BJP successfully exploited divisions in the Congress ranks to pull off an impossible win \u2014 six Congress MLAs cross-voted for the BJP \u2014 the Congress in Karnataka managed to close ranks behind its candidates Ajay Maken, Syed Nasir Hussain and G C Chandrashekhar to deny an improbable win for the JD(S)-BJP candidate. A series of measures taken over the last couple of months did the trick for the Congress. From Cabinet-rank appointments for dozens of MLAs in January, with the promise of more appointments, to the corralling of all MLAs in a resort ahead of the February 27 election, and holding mock-voting sessions, all played a part in the party\u2019s success in Karnataka. While Siddaramaiah played a significant role in keeping MLAs happy in the run-up to the election, Shivakumar \u2014 the Deputy CM, state party president, and past master at keeping the Congress MLA flock together for Rajya Sabha polls and other situations \u2014 played a major part in the final stretch. Amid mounting unhappiness among Congress MLAs who missed out on Cabinet berths last year, the CM and the Congress high command approved the appointment of 34 MLAs as chairpersons of boards and corporations on January 26. Earlier in August 2023, soon after the government was formed eight appointments had been made.\u00a0 An equal number of party workers were also given plum posts in the state administration on the recommendations of MLAs. The Cabinet-rank appointments for MLAs were intended to keep the party flock together in the run-up to the Lok Sabha polls and are believed to have played a significant role in the Rajya Sabha poll win as well. In the days leading to the poll, Shivakumar who is aspiring to be the next CM played a pivotal role in ensuring thatRahul Gandhi\u2019s associate Ajay Maken,Mallikarjun Kharge\u2019s associate Nasir Hussain, and old Congress hand G C Chandrashekhar won the polls. Shivakumar played a key role in corralling all 134 Congress MLAs in a resort a day before the election, training them to vote correctly through mock-voting sessions, and ensuring that four Independent MLAs, including former BJP minister G Janardhan Reddy, supported the Congress candidates. Among the two most surprising moves that the Congress made that paid dividends was the filing of anFIRby Congress MLA Ravi Ganiga, a close associate of Shivakumar, accusing Kupendra Reddy of offering bribes to Independent legislators Latha Mallikarjun, Puttaswamy Gowda, and Darshan Puttanaiah to vote for him. The second move was to solicit the support of G Janardhan Reddy, an Independent MLA, despite his almost pariah status on account of the CBI cases of illegal mining that are pending against him. Despite his apparent discomfiture, Siddaramaiah also welcomed Janardhan Reddy\u2019s support for the Congress. The Deputy CM also played a role in getting two BJP MLAs to the Congress side. S T Somashekhar who was earlier in the Congressvoted for Congress while Shivaram Hebbar, also a former Congress legislator, did not turn up to vote. In the end, Maken and Nasir Nasir Hussain got 47 votes each and Chandrashekhar got 45 votes. The fourth winner was the BJP\u2019s Narayansa Bhandage who got 47 votes. Kupendra Reddy ended up with only 36 votes. Although Shivakumar does not enjoy the support of the majority of the MLAs, he is considered a loyal party worker and is keen to impress the Congress high command that is likely to take a call on changing CMs mid-way through the five-year tenure, which will be around the end of 2025. Siddaramaiah is known to enjoy the unequivocal support of nearly 100 of the 135 Congress MLAs, something that prompted the Congress leadership to make him the CM of the state for a second time in May 2023. With Shivakumar helping the Congress win the RS polls in Karnataka, he was dispatched to Himachal Pradesh on Wednesday to manage a situation where the Congress government headed by CMSukhvinder Singh Sukhuslipped into a crisis after losing a Rajya Sabha seat from a winning position on account of six Congress MLAs voting for the BJP. \u201cI do not know why BJP is in such a hurry to conquer two to three states. Any government must also have a strong Opposition. It is not good for democratic values to indulge in such type of horse trading \u2013 someday it will boomerang. It is a very bad precedent,\u201d Shivakumar said before leaving forShimlaon Wednesday. Weeks before the general elections, IE 100, the list of the 100 most powerful Indians this year, maps the lay of the land \u2014 the BJP holding strong, the Opposition trying to hold it together.

removes Wayanad district president K P Madhu over his comments against Christian priests", "content": "Days after the Kerala BJP\u2019s Wayanad district president K P Madhu accused Christian priests of provoking the recent mass protest against the escalating man-animal conflict in the district, the saffron party on Wednesday removed him from the post. The Bharatiya Janata Party replaced Madhu with party leader Prasanth Malavayal in Wayanad, which is represented by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi in Lok Sabha. When contacted, Madhu said he lost the post ofWayanaddistrict president over his comment. \u201cMy statement was construed against the national policy of the party. Hence, I was removed. I will continue in the party district committee,\u201d he said. Madhu has been under attack from churches in Wayanad after he said \u201cmen in cassock\u201d were behind the violent mass protest on February 17, a day after a forest protection committee member was killed by a wild elephant near Pulpally. Thousands of people, cutting across political and religious lines, had gathered at Pulpally with the body of the victim, Vellachalil Paul, protesting government inaction in finding a permanent solution for the wildlife menace. Paul was the third person to be killed in a wild elephant attack in the district in the last two months. Madhu had blamed the police for unilaterally taking action againstBJPworkers in connection with the tension at Pulpally. He had stated priests had provoked the people to stage violent agitation, which culminated in a scuffle between police and the crowd. The BJP leader\u2019s comment on priests had evoked protests from the Church, particularly the Catholic segment with considerable sway in the farmer belt. The comment had also embarrassed the BJP which has been trying to get closer to the Christian segment in Kerala. The Church had also protested in Wayanad, demanding the intervention of the Centre and state government to solve the animal attacks. Archbishop Joseph Pamplany, who had once stated that Christians would back the BJP if the price of rubber is raised to Rs 250 per kg, had also come out against Madhu\u2019s comment. Addressing a gathering in Wayanad, Pamplany said priests have been with the people of Wayanad for the last 75 years and they would continue to be so. Weeks before the general elections, IE 100, the list of the 100 most powerful Indians this year, maps the lay of the land \u2014 the BJP holding strong, the Opposition trying to hold it together.

Pichai admits \u2018unacceptable\u2019 errors in Gemini after it produces controversial imagery", "content": "Google\u2019s Gemini AI image generation tool previously received plenty of flak and became the subject of memes, particularly on Twitter, for \u2018historical accuracies\u2019 and misrepresenting people. It got so bad that the search engine giant was forced to snatch away the ability to produce images from the AI chatbot. This week,GoogleCEO Sundar Pichai addressed these missteps of the company\u2019s new AI image generator,Gemini, acknowledging the \u201cunacceptable\u201d errors and affirming Google\u2019s commitment to fixing the problems. In an internal memo published bySemafor, Pichai wrote that \u201cno AI is perfect\u201d but said the company would continue refining Gemini \u201cfor however long it takes.\u201d He remained upbeat about Gemini\u2019s future, saying the team has already seen \u201csubstantial improvement\u201d in many areas. The image generation capabilities of Gemini, formerly known as Bard, have been paused since users noticed it was churning out historically inaccurate pictures, like images of Vikings and Founding Fathers depicted as people of colour. This sparked backlash on social media, with many critics decrying the \u201cwoke\u201d programming. Google SVP Prabhakar Raghavan clarified this was not intentional wokeness on the company\u2019s part but rather a series of tuning errors. He revealed in a blog post published February 23 that, essentially, Gemini was calibrated to allow for diversity in generated images but failed to exclude inappropriate contexts for that diversity. Over time, Raghavan explained, Gemini also became more cautious, sometimes refusing reasonable prompts out of an abundance of sensitivity. This aligns with reports that Gemini declined to generate images of white people in some cases. Gemini\u2019s image generator will return after fixes, Google says, including \u201cstructural changes, updated product guidelines, improved launch processes, robust evals and red-teaming.\u201d Weeks before the general elections, IE 100, the list of the 100 most powerful Indians this year, maps the lay of the land \u2014 the BJP holding strong, the Opposition trying to hold it together.

"https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/bangalore/kannada-signage-shops-deadline-extended-9187713/": {"source": "Indian Express", "headline": "Deadline for Bengaluru shops to implement 60% Kannada signage extended by 2 weeks", "content": "The Karnataka government has decided to extend the deadline for signage implementation with 60 per cent Kannada content by commercial establishments in Bengaluru by two weeks as it was set to end on Thursday. \u201cConsidering that it takes time to change the signage, Karnataka Govt has decided to extend the deadline given to commercial establishments by two more weeks so that the 60 per cent signage in Kannada rule can be followed,\u201d Deputy Chief Minister D K Shivakumar said on social media on Thursday. \u201cIt is important that we uphold our mother tongue in utmost respect. Therefore, we expect this law to be duly followed, and we shall see compliance with it by the end of the two-week extended period,\u201d he said. The Karnataka government amended the Kannada Language Comprehensive Development Act to ensure that all signages in the state have a 60 per cent Kannada component. The move followed protests by pro-Kannada organisations against the use of 100 per cent English signage by shops and commercial establishments in the state. In December 2023, Kannada activists vandalised English signage at many establishments in north Bengaluru in protest against the non-usage of Kannada on signboards. Chief MinisterSiddaramaiahannounced at the time that his government would introduce a law to ensure that 60 per cent of space on signboards and nameplates are dedicated to Kannada, with the rest left to any other language. \u201cKannada is supreme in Karnataka and the government will take all steps to promote the language,\u201d Siddaramaiah said in December 2023. The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) issued a circular in December 2023 saying that all commercial establishments in Bengaluru must erect signages in Kannada prominently before February 29, 2024. The Karnataka government passed the Kannada Language Comprehensive Development (Amendment) Bill, 2024, last week to mandate 60 per cent Kannada usage in name boards of various establishments in the state. All outlets will have to display Kannada in the upper half of the signage, according to the Bill. The Bill was introduced as an ordinance in the first week of January, days after pro-Kannada protestors resorted to violence in parts of Bengaluru over the lack of Kannada in name boards. However, the governor did not clear the ordinance and returned it to the government and recommended tabling it as a Bill in the state legislature. Weeks before the general elections, IE 100, the list of the 100 most powerful Indians this year, maps the lay of the land \u2014 the BJP holding strong, the Opposition trying to hold it together.

"content": "Written by Pramod Kumar Meherda Considering the need for positive supplementary income support for the farmer families in the country and to promote a productive, competitive, diversified, inclusive and sustainable agriculture sector, the Government of India launched an ambitious scheme for farmers\u2019 welfare on February 2, 2019 \u2014 the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-Kisan). It is now one of the largest Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) schemes in the world. Under the scheme, eligible farmer families are provided a benefit of Rs 6000 per year in three equal instalments of Rs 2000 each, every four months. The benefit is transferred directly to the bank accounts of eligible beneficiaries through the DBT mode, using modern digital technology. The scheme is a shining example of cooperative federalism as the states register and verify the eligibility of farmers while the GoI provides 100 per cent funding for the scheme. Since the launch of this path-breaking scheme, there has been no looking back. In the last five years, it has crossed many milestones and has received accolades from various organisations, including the World Bank, for its sheer vision, scale, and the seamless transfer of funds directly to the accounts of eligible farmers. A study conducted by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) on farmers of Uttar Pradesh indicates that the benefits under the PM-Kisan scheme reached the majority of farmers, and they received the full amount without any leakages. As per the same study, the farmers receiving cash transfers under PM-Kisan were more likely to invest in buying agricultural equipment, seeds, fertilisers, and pesticides. The inclusive nature of the scheme is reflected in the fact that at least one out of four beneficiaries is a woman farmer, besides more than 85 per cent of small and marginal farmers being the beneficiaries under the scheme. To make the scheme more efficient, effective, and transparent, continuous improvements in a farmer-centric digital infrastructure have been made to ensure the benefits of the scheme reach all the farmers across the country without any middleman involvement. The PM-Kisan portal was integrated with the portals of the Unique Identification Authority of India, the Public Financial Management System, the National Payments Corporation of India, and the Income Tax Department. The states/ UTs and all other stakeholders were on-boarded on the PM-Kisan platform to provide quick services to the farmers. Several technological interventions have been implemented to empower farmers with information and facilities at their fingertips. Some of the significant farmer-centric initiatives are as follows. There is a dedicated web portal and a mobile application for the beneficiaries to know their present status. The \u201cKnow Your Status\u201d (KYS) module allows one to view all the mandatory requirements such as the status of land seeding,Aadhaarlinking with bank accounts and e-KYC in a single click. A mobile application with the facial authentication-based e-KYC feature for ease of doing eKYC across the country has also been made available. While farmers can register their grievances on the PM-Kisan portal and take the help of a 24\u00d77 call facility for an effective and timely resolution, the Government of India has also developed \u2018Kisan e-Mitra\u2019 (a voice-based AI Chatbot), which enables farmers to raise queries and get them resolved in their own language in real-time. The Kisan-eMitra is now available in 10 languages, i.e., English, Hindi, Odia, Tamil, Bangla, Malayalam, Gujarati, Punjabi, Telugu and Marathi. There has also been an onboarding of over 4 lakh Common Service Centres across the country to provide services of the scheme at farmers\u2019 doorsteps. Onboarding of the Indian Post Payments Bank (IPPB) with the PM-Kisan scheme has facilitated the opening of Aadhaar bank accounts of the beneficiaries at their convenience and doorsteps without any hassle. To address the issue of farmers at the village level, nodal officers have been designated in all villages across the country. Recently, as part of the Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra, the Government of India launched a nationwide campaign to saturate the PM-Kisan scheme with eligible farmers. During the campaign, over 90 lakh eligible farmers, including 6 lakh Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups\u2019 (PVTG) farmers, were included under the PM-Kisan scheme. A continuous impact assessment for further improvement in the scheme is also done by taking feedback through the Kisan Call Centre and field surveys. The 16th instalment of the PM-Kisan scheme, amounting to Rs 21,000 crores was released to more than 9 crore farmers on February 28 by Prime MinisterNarendra Modifrom Yavatmal, Maharashtra. With the 16th instalment amount included, the scheme has benefitted more than 11 crore eligible farmer families with Rs 3 lakh crore transferred directly to their accounts in the last five years. Of this, Rs 1.75 lakh crore have been transferred to eligible farmers during theCovid-19period alone, when they needed direct cash benefits the most. It is but obvious to reflect on the stupendous impact this scheme has had on the lives of the farmers in the last five years by directly benefiting them in times of need.

"https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/pune/pune-mephedrone-bust-probe-money-trail-hawala-transactions-9187610/": {"source": "Indian Express", "headline": "Pune: Mephedrone bust probe now centered around money trail, substantial hawala transactions", "content": "The investigation into one of the biggest mephedrone busts in the country is now centred around the money trail within the cartel including some substantial hawala transactions, suggesting parking of large funds abroad. Additionally, the investigators are also looking at the procurement of raw materials used in the manufacturing of the synthetic stimulant. In one of the biggest-ever mephedrone hauls in the country till date, thePunecity police crime branch had seized nearly 1,836 kg of mephedrone worth nearly Rs 3,672 crore in several raids conducted last week at a chemical manufacturing factory in Daund taluka, two godowns in Pune\u2019s Vishrantwadi, some shops in South Extension in NewDelhiand some more places in Sangli district. The probe has unearthed a sophisticated production line for the synthetic stimulant, being run from a chemical factory disguised as a pharmaceutical unit at an industrial cluster in Kurkumbh in Daund. In addition to these drugs being sent to major cities across the country, large quantities of drugs were also smuggled to London in ready-to-eat food packets shipped by a courier agency in Delhi, the investigation has revealed. At the heart of this investigation is its alleged mastermind, Sundip Dhunay, a 42-year-old British national of Indian origin, who is believed to have fled from India to a West Asian country via Nepal sometime before the crackdown by police began. A Red Corner Notice through the Interpol (International Criminal Police Organisation) has been issued against him. Speaking toIndian Expresson Wednesday, police commissioner Amitesh Kumar said, \u201cOne of the key focus areas of the probe now is the money trail including some hawala transactions that we are trying to ascertain. We are also looking at how the procurement of the raw material was done and what happened to money obtained from the sale of the drugs. We hope that these aspects will further unearth the nexus of the cartel.\u201d Senior officials said the hawala transactions that they are probing are of large sums of money and point to parking of funds, which were amassed from the sale of mephedrone to foreign countries. Police have till now arrested 10 suspects in the case including the chemical synthesis expert, the owners of the Vishrantwadi godown, Kurkumbh factory and also those linked to the Delhi courier company. Police have also issued Lookout Circulars against some suspects including one Virendra Singh, who is linked to the courier firm in Delhi. Late on Tuesday night, a team from the Pune City police detained a suspect from West Bengal, which is linked to several suspects arrested till now and is believed to have played a key role in the operations of the cartel. The process of securing his transit remand and bringing him to Pune has been initiated, according to the latest reports. Dhunay was arrested in 2016 by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) for running a massive mephedrone production unit from a chemical factory in Kurkumbh, in the same industrial cluster where the police had conducted the raid last week. Probe by Pune police suggests that when Dhunay was lodged in Yerawada prison after his arrest by the DRI, he had started putting together his crew for the next operation. After he secured bail, he started using the people he met in prison as transporters in the racket that has now been unearthed. Even as on Wednesday, at least half a dozen teams of city police were stationed at various places across the country probing some key aspects of the case. \u201cProbe in this case has brought to light both wholesale and retail supply chains of the cartel. After having probed the wholesale chains initially, we have launched a probe into the retail chains of the cartel and how the small packets of the product were reaching the end users,\u201d Amitesh Kumar has earlier said. Weeks before the general elections, IE 100, the list of the 100 most powerful Indians this year, maps the lay of the land \u2014 the BJP holding strong, the Opposition trying to hold it together.

arriving on March 5: Everything you need to know", "content": "The UK-based smartphone brand, Nothing, has carved a name for itself when it comes to smartphones with striking designs. Now, the company is gearing up to announce its third device \u2013Nothing Phone (2a) on March 5. At the Mobile World Congress 2024, the company gave a glimpse of its upcoming device. While the design has been revealed, there is a lot about the device that is still under wraps.  Here is everything that we have learned so far about the upcoming Nothing Phone (2a), which is also expected to be the most affordable smartphone from the brand. Looking at the rear panel, it is very evident that the design of the Phone (2a) is in line with the company\u2019s design philosophy. However, it also looks drastically different from the first two phones, thanks to the positioning of the dual-camera setup at the top centre with three Glyph light bars. The horizontally positioned dual-camera setup gives this phone a new look, and the entire back panel seems to revolve around the camera unit. In one of the videos, the company has also confirmed that the Nothing Phone (2a) uses a plastic frame and a plastic back panel. However, the power and volume buttons are still made using metal. On the white variant, the company is using black coloured buttons to offer a contrasty look to the device, which reminds me of the Pixel 4a. The Nothing Phone (2a) only has three Glyph light bars, while thePhone (2) (review)has 11. The plastic frame and body also mean the phone could be significantly lighter. Upon close inspection, it becomes very evident that the Nothing Phone (2a) will miss out on wireless charging, which has been a staple feature on previous models. From the front, the device looks just like the Phone (2). According to leaks, the Phone (2a) comes with a 6.7-inch AMOLED screen with 120Hz refresh rate and the device also includes an in-display fingerprint sensor. A few days ago, Carl Pei, the CEO of Nothing confirmed that the Phone (2a) is powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 7200 Pro SoC. One of the teaser images of the Phone (2a) also confirms that the phone offers up to 12 GB of RAM and 256 GB of internal storage. Considering the previous devices, the Phone (2a) might not offer a microSD card slot, but it is likely to include dual nano SIM slots. The Mediatek Dimensity 7200 is an octa-core processor fabbed by TSMC using a 2nd Gen 4nm process with a peak CPU clock speed of 2.8 GHz and Arm Mali G610 MC4 GPU. The chipset supports UFS 3.1-type storage, and we expect to see the same on the Phone (2a). It also comes with APU 650 to handle AI-related tasks. Considering the capabilities of the Dimensity 7200 SoC, the Nothing Phone (2a) will offer 5G connectivity, Bluetooth 5.3, and Wi-Fi 6E. As per the leaks, just like the Phone (1) and (2), the Nothing Phone (2a) will also offer a dual 50 MP camera at the back, and these could be newer and better sensors. Another leak suggests that the Phone (2a) will come with a 5,000 mAh battery, which makes it the biggest battery that the company has ever shipped on a phone. Considering this, we expect the Phone (2a) to deliver enhanced battery life, and it is also expected to support fast charging of 45W. Weeks before the general elections, IE 100, the list of the 100 most powerful Indians this year, maps the lay of the land \u2014 the BJP holding strong, the Opposition trying to hold it together.

mum-to-be Deepika Padukone spoke about how she kickstarts her day", "content": "Congratulations are in order for celebrity couple and actorsDeepika Padukoneand Ranveer Singh, who took to social media to announce their pregnancy and that they\u2019re expecting a baby in September 2024. Considering we often come across reports on how Deepika stays fit, we decided to dig deep to find a video snippet of theBajirao Mastaniactor sharing how she likes to kickstart her day. \u201cStarting my day with a workout is really important. I may not be able to workout 6-7 days a week but at least 3-4 times a week. I have to start my day with it,\u201d sharedDeepikain a video snippet shared by Bollyzone. Taking a cue, here\u2019s why a workout is a good way to begin your day. Commencing the day with physical activity is a cornerstone habit that positively influences overall health, experts urge. According to fitness expert Garima Goyal, incorporating movement into the morning routine has numerous benefits for the body and mind. \u201cFrom a physical standpoint, it kickstarts the metabolism, setting the pace for calorie burning throughout the day. Whether it\u2019s a brisk walk, a shortworkout, or a yoga session, these activities enhance cardiovascular health, improve flexibility, and contribute to weight management,\u201d said Goyal. Beyond the physical benefits, morning exercise has profound effects on mental well-being. Goyal mentioned that engaging in physical activity releases endorphins, the body\u2019s natural mood lifters, which can significantly impact one\u2019s emotional state. \u201cThis mood enhancement sets a positive tone for the day, reducing stress and anxiety. Additionally, morning exercise has been linked to improved cognitive function and better focus throughout theday,\u201d said Goyal. Developing the habit of morning movement can be as simple as setting aside 20-30 minutes each morning for a workout routine or a brisk walk. Goyal urged that the key is consistency; making it a daily ritual reinforces the habit and ensures that the positive effects compound over time. \u201cEstablish a regular exercise routine that blends cardiovascular, strength training, and flexibility exercises. Consistency is crucial for long-term benefits. Chooseactivitiesyou enjoy to make it sustainable over the years,\u201d said Goyal. Minimise sedentary behaviour, mentioned Goyal. \u201cIf you have adesk job, take breaks to stretch and move throughout the day. Incorporate physical activity into daily tasks, such as taking the stairs or going for short walks,\u201d said Goyal. Establish realistic and achievable fitness goals. \u201cSetting goals provides motivation and direction, but they should be attainable and adaptable. Celebrate small victories along the way, and be willing to adjust your goals when needed,\u201d Goyal said.

teeters, how often has draw of lots been used? Almost never", "content": "The BJP\u2019s shock victory Tuesday inthe election to the lone Rajya Sabha seat in Himachal Pradesh, where the Congress is in power,may be one of the rare instances where the winner was decided by a draw of lots. After six Congress MLAs cross-voted, the party\u2019s candidate Abhishek Manu Singhvi andBJPnominee Harsh Mahajan got 34 votes each. In the event of a tie, the winner must be decided by a draw of lots, in which Mahajan eventually emerged as the victor. TheRajya SabhaMPs are elected by the respective state Legislative Assemblies\u2019 members through proportional representation of a single transferable vote. Like other elections, voting for the Rajya Sabha polls, too, were meant to have a secret ballot. But, in 2003, the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government amended the Representation of the People (RP) Act, 1951 to enable an \u201copen ballot\u201d for elections to the Upper House. When this was legally challenged by ex-MP and journalist Kuldip Nayar, the Supreme Court upheld it in 2006. \u201cThe contention that the right of expression of the voter at an election for the Council of States is affected by open ballot is not tenable, as an elected MLA would not face any disqualification from the membership of the House for voting in a particular manner. He may at the most attract action from the political party to which he belongs,\u201d the court had observed. The RP Act provides for a draw of lots to decide the winner in case of an \u201cequality of votes\u201d in an election. \u201cIf, after the counting of the votes is completed, an equality of votes is found to exist between any candidates, and the addition of one vote will entitle any of those candidates to be declared elected, the returning officer shall forthwith decide between those candidates by lot, and proceed as if the candidate on whom the lot falls had received an additional vote,\u201d Section 65 of the Act states. In the case of an election petition \u2013 a legal challenge to an election result \u2013 if there is an equality of votes, the High Court \u201cshall decide between them by lot and proceed as if the one on whom the lot then falls had received an additional vote,\u201d says Section 102 of the Act. However, in the case of a tie in a Rajya Sabha election, Section 81 (3) of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961 applies, according to former legal advisor to the Election Commission (EC) S K Mendiratta. The section says in case there is only one vacancy and two candidates have the same value of votes, \u201cthe returning officer shall decide by lot which of them shall be excluded; and after excluding him in the manner aforesaid, declare the other candidate to be elected\u201d. One seat in Himachal Pradesh went to the polls on Tuesday, as part of a total of 56 Rajya Sabha seats across 15 states, which would fall vacant in April due to the retirement of MPs. In the 68-member state Assembly, the Congress has 40 MLAs and the support of three Independents, while the BJP has 25 MLAs. After cross-voting by six Congress MLAs and the three Independents supporting the BJP candidate, both parties\u2019 nominees got 34 votes each, leading to a draw of lots. Singhvi\u2019s name figured in the slip drawn, which led to his defeat and election of Mahajan. The EC does not maintain data on results of the Rajya Sabha elections on its website, while its spokesperson did not respond to queries if the Himachal case was the first one. The Upper House elections have become more competitive in recent years. The Congress\u2019s candidate in the 2022 Rajya Sabha election from Haryana, Ajay Maken, was defeated when a party MLA cross-voted in favour of Independent candidate Kartikeya Sharma. \u201cThe last three decades have seen a shift in Rajya Sabha elections. What earlier used to be a safe route to Parliament is now a no-holds-barred competitive process. Political parties can no longer count on the discipline of their legislators to assure the victory of their candidates. And this is after the law has changed requiring MLAs to show their vote to their party representative before casting it,\u201d said Chakshu Roy, the head of legislative and civic engagement at PRS Legislative Research. According to former Chief Election Commissioner O P Rawat, the use of a draw of lots to decide the Rajya Sabha polls was \u201cunheard of\u201d, though there had been rare instances of it being used in the Assembly and the Lok Sabha elections. The draw of lots has been used in the elections to local bodies in the past. In 2020, the Madras High Court had upheld the validity of the rule regarding the draw of lots in the Tamil Nadu Panchayats (Elections) Rules when it was challenged. The election to ward number 220 of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) in 2017 was decided by a draw of lots when both the BJP andShiv Senacandidates got an equal number of votes.

Awesome to look at but overstuffed, Japanese historical epic is a grounded alternative to Game of Thrones", "content": "Breathtaking to behold, but at the same time, almost too unwieldy to comprehend, FX\u2019s Shogun is an inconsistent affair whose downsides ultimately outweigh its achievements. Based on a book by James Clavell \u2014 the author whose historical fictions tended to be over a thousand pages long and exclusively aboutwhite people in Asian territories\u2014 Shogun is a sprawling epic that, an effort to spread the love, sacrifices what is often the most important thing in storytelling: a point-of-view. For all intents and purposes, British sailor John Blackthorne is given the standard heroes journey, but there\u2019s something not quite right about asking the audience to latch onto the sole white man in a story set entirely in feudal Japan. And creators Rachel Kondo and Justin Marks appear to have regonised this. At a conservative estimate, about 70% of Shogun is in the Japanese language, which is highly unusual for an American production. This is also a welcome change from the 1980 NBC adaptation of Clavell\u2019s novel, which avoided subtitles altogether. The filmmakers argued that they wanted to put audiences in Blackthorne\u2019s shoes. The 10-episode mini-series, which is being aired in India on Disney+ Hotstar, actively pushes back against this approach. Also read \u2013Monarch \u2013 Legacy of Monsters review: Apple\u2019s excellent Godzilla series favours narrative ambition over monster mayhem Played byCosmo Jarvislike a cross between Ozzy Osborne and that man from the viral Democracy Manifest meme, Blackthorne washes up on the shores of a Japan on the brink of civil war. He\u2019s the first Brit to set foot on Japan, a territory kept secret from the West by the Portuguese who first discovered it. Blackthorne finds that the Japanese are in the middle of some sort of game of thrones, with several warring factions vying to fill the power vacuum left by the previous \u2018daimyo\u2019. Chief among them \u2014 or, at least, the man we spend the most time with \u2014 is Lord Yoshii Toranaga, played by the legendary Hiroyuki Sanada as pretty much the parallel protagonist. Hovering around Toranaga is another \u2018daimyo\u2019, Kashigi Yabushige, played by Tadanobu Asano, andAnna Sawai\u2019s Toda Mariko, the young wife of a samurai, destined to become something of a feminist icon. Toranaga is quick to realise that Blackthorne might be the perfect pawn in his efforts to protect himself against mounting pressure from his rivals. It\u2019s common knowledge that Toranaga\u2019s growing influence has isolated him from the other \u2018daimyos\u2019. He summons Blackthorne, then a prisoner in Yabushige\u2019s territory, to meet with him in Osaka. And after a couple of adventures \u2014 Blackthorne proves himself to be a worthy soldier \u2014 Toranaga develops a trust for his new plaything, eventually elevating him to the position of samurai. Shogun begins interestingly enough \u2014 the visuals are extraordinary and the world-building detailed \u2014 but the show loses its grip only a couple of episodes in. There could be many reasons for this, but primarily, it\u2019s the sheer number of characters that that becomes overwhelming. Not all of them have important roles, but they\u2019re often introduced as if they might. Their job is to essentially deliver exposition, bark commands, or express emotion on somebody else\u2019s behalf. But perhaps because of the show\u2019s dedication to not short-changing any Japanese character \u2014 we\u2019re often made privy to their private conversations about the white outsider \u2014 these tertiary characters are given far too much prominence than they ideally would have. Meanwhile, your conditioning as a viewer of Western storytelling means that you\u2019re automatically drawn towards Blackthorne, not in the least because Shogun itself appears to circle back to him periodically. We enter this world through his perspective, like a parrot perched on his shoulder. And for all the \u2018barbarian\u2019 talk \u2014 he\u2019s perceived as little more than vermin initially \u2014 the Japanese point-of-view always feels secondary. Shogun isn\u2019t the perspective-shift that it could have been, it\u2019s merely a perspective dilution. For instance, when Blackthorne communicates, in the crudest manner possible, that Catholicism isn\u2019t the only form of Christianity, we enter the scene from his point-of-view, and not of the Japanese who\u2019ve just had their minds blown. Read more \u2013Expats review: Nicole Kidman leads an excellent ensemble in Prime Video\u2019s evocative miniseries There could be a minor overlap here with Martin Scorsese\u2019s Silence. And certainly, a lot of the show\u2019s visual language appears to have been inspired not only by old Japanese films, but also by cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto\u2019s work on Scorsese\u2019s lost masterpiece. But unlike that film, which mainly dealt with the psychological turmoil of an overzealous missionary, Shogun is a more outwardly ambitious project. It features many battles both big and small, and certainly, no expense has been spared in the fine costumes and lavishly mounted sets. But with no emotional anchor, watching it is like being unmoored at sea.

{"source": "Indian Express", "headline": "Interview with Hockey India secretary general Bholanath Singh: \u2018Knew that if Schopman stayed after Asian Games, India won\u2019t qualify for Paris\u2019", "content": "In less than a week, the women\u2019s hockey team coach and Hockey India\u2019s CEO quit citing similar reasons \u2013 difficult working conditions. The first was women\u2019s coachJanneke Schopman, who said it was \u2018very, very difficult\u2019 to deal with people in Hockey India. Then, on Tuesday, the body\u2019s CEO Elena Norman too resigned. While she told the Press Trust of India that factionalism within Hockey India was one of the reasons for her quitting, Hockey India president Dilip Tirkey in an email to the board pointed at the \u2018difficult working conditions\u2019. Both Schopman and Norman hailed Tirkey\u2019s support but did not mention the name of the other key office-bearer, the secretary-general Bholanath Singh, who is in the eye of the storm. In an interview withThe Indian Express, Bholanath Singh refuted claims of a rift between him and Tirkey, as Norman suggested, and dismissed Schopman\u2019s allegations of bias against the women\u2019s team. Excerpts: How do you react to the two resignations and the claims made? Whatever is being said is false. The truth is something else. Then what is the truth, according to you? Now is not the right time for it. The day I speak\u2026 I won\u2019t say anything else. Shanti hai, shanti rehne dijiye (It\u2019s peaceful now, let it remain like that). People say a lot of things about me and Dilip ji, none of which is true. We get along very well. The women\u2019s team coach, too, said some things before resigning. Wasn\u2019t she respected here for four years? If she felt like that, she could have said it anytime during these four years. But when India didn\u2019t qualify for the Olympics, all these things came up. The Olympic qualifier was to take place in China, from there we got it to India and held it in Ranchi where people were out in full force to support them. What else can we do? Even after all this if the team can\u2019t qualify, can\u2019t we even ask where we fell short? And whom will we ask, the coach only right? Kahin kuch na milein toh naariyal kahan phod do, toh Bhola ji k bagal mein jo pathar hai uspar maariye.(When you don\u2019t have anywhere to break a coconut, you hit it on the stone next to Bhola [Shiv] ji). Where did the team fall short? Maybe we should have removed the coach before the Asian Games. Or she should have left. Maybe then the team would have qualified. All the players are good. After all, it was more or less the same set of players that finished fourth at the (Tokyo) Olympics. Is it true that you wanted to sack the coach after the Asian Games and Dilip Tirkey intervened? Yes, I had clearly told everyone that if she stays, India can never qualify for the Olympics. And I wasn\u2019t saying this. Our selectors, too, were of this opinion. It is being said the women\u2019s team wanted a psychologist but you initially denied their request. That is not the truth. The men\u2019s team coach, Craig (Fulton), told me they wanted a psychologist. He selected the same psychologist who was in the team when (former cricket captain MS) Dhoni won the World Cup (in 2011). His per-day rate was high but we decided to go ahead because we didn\u2019t want money to come in the way of performance. Janneke demanded a psychologist too. She gave the name of some psychologist, who charged the same rate as the men\u2019s team psychologist. So I said this (women\u2019s team) psychologist isn\u2019t of the same level and asked her to revise her fees. When the issue was resolved, the psychologist was on board. It wasn\u2019t an issue. It hasn\u2019t ever happened \u2013 with men\u2019s or women\u2019s teams \u2013 that they say a word and we waste a second to get it done. We don\u2019t interfere anywhere. The only thing we want is results. It\u2019s alleged that you do not have the necessary understanding of hockey since you come from a wrestling background. (Laughs) In Jharkhand, hockey existed way before I was born. It doesn\u2019t matter whether you are from wrestling or hockey. It\u2019s how you think, what\u2019s your ambition, how will athletes give a good result\u2026 that\u2019s the main thing. Planning and system for most sports is almost the same. So what is your plan for Indian hockey? When I took over, I wanted the women\u2019s team to qualify for the Olympics and feature in the top five. And from the men\u2019s team, there was a clear expectation of a medal, colour doesn\u2019t matter. I only care about the Olympics, the Asian Games and the World Cup. At the Asian Games, I hoped both teams would win a gold medal. We did not doubt that the men\u2019s team wouldn\u2019t win gold. Women\u2019s team, we were wary of China (to whom India eventually lost). I won\u2019t lie about that. But in the qualifier that took place in Ranchi, I wasn\u2019t expecting that India would lose to Japan and the USA. Hockey India must have reviewed what went wrong. What was the assessment? After looking at all the aspects, I warned (after the Asian Games) that it would be tough for India if this coach stayed. Was there anything in the review that led you to believe that? I am a coach, too. Even I know what coaching is, what the systems are. What\u2019s your experience in coaching? I was the coach of India\u2019s wrestling team. In 2002-03, of the freestyle India team. I coach even today. What do you think I am? Even I am an India coach! Will Hockey India have a new CEO? Dilip Ji and I will sit together and decide that. And will the women\u2019s team\u2019s new coach be a foreigner or an Indian? You\u2019ll have to wait and watch. But whatever will happen, it\u2019ll be for the best. Have you started the process yet? Yes, I can say the talks are at an advanced stage. Very soon everything will be done.

Goa researchers claim breakthrough in producing nanoparticles", "content": "Two researchers in Goa have said that they synthesised gold nanoparticles from a wild mushroom species that is widely eaten as a delicacy in the coastal state. Mushrooms of the Termitomyces species, which grow on termite hills and is locally known as \u2018roen olmi\u2019, is an edible wild mushroom popular among Goans and consumed during the monsoons. According to the new research, this species of mushroom has been cultured in a pure three-dimensional pelletised form and successfully used to produce gold nanoparticles. The research, titled \u2018Biosynthesis and characterisation of AuNPs produced using Termitomyces heimii Pellets\u2019 was published recently in the Geomicrobiology Journal published by Taylor and Francis. On Tuesday, the researchers \u2013 Dr Sujata Dabolkar and Dr Nandkumar Kamat \u2013 presented the findings of their research before Aleixo Sequeira,Goa\u2019s Environment Minister and chairman of the Goa State Biodiversity Board (GSBB). They also shared a draft roadmap for the Goa government, saying that the \u201cbreakthrough\u201d has vast economic and bioindustrial implications for Goa, which can benefit by sustainable use of this local mushroom species. The researchers said that with advancements in biomedical and biotechnological sciences, the demand for gold nanoparticles in various applications, such as targeted drug delivery, medical imaging and electronics manufacturing, is projected to skyrocket. Dr Nandkumar Kamat, a scientist who has been studying this variety of mushrooms for over three decades, said Goa has the largest species diversity and gene pool of the wild edible Termitomyces mushrooms. \u201cFor the first time, this species of mushroom has been brought in pure culture, grown as pellets, and used to produce gold nanoparticles. The breakthrough pioneers the use of an eco-friendly species for mass production of gold nanoparticles. Other countries are using very toxic chemical agents for production,\u201d said Kamat. \u201cThis wealth belongs to the country and needs to be conserved and judiciously used for industrial applications by sharing benefits with the local community. The Nagoya protocol gives GSBB the mandate to use these resources for industries while sharing benefits with the local community,\u201d he added. Dr Sujata Dabolkar, assistant professor at government college, Quepem, said, \u201cEarlier, people used extracts\u2026 We have used pellets to synthesise gold nanoparticles.

Earlier training used to happen on other motorised gliders. Every cadet has to complete 10 sorties during their sixth term flying training. The training at the AFTT has three main aspects: flying training, ground training and air warrior training. The third astronaut-designate Gp Capt Angad Pratap was born in Prayagraj on July 17 in 1982 and passed out from the NDA in 2003.

Here the cadets not just receive lessons in basics of military aviation but also develop the temperament that is required to be a military aviator. But what further connects all the four astronaut-designates and also Wing Commander Rakesh Sharma, is that they have all been accomplished test pilots which gives all of them that edge to face the challenges of spacecrafts.\u201d \u2018Matter of immense pride\u2019 NDA Commandant Vice Admiral Ajay Kochhar said, \u201cIt is indeed a matter of immense pride for the NDA that the four astronauts selected to be part of the historic Gaganyaan Mission have all passed out from its hallowed portals. This unique achievement in pursuit of our country\u2019s maiden manned mission is yet another milestone crossed by the cadets of the National Defence Academy in conquering uncharted territory and bringing laurels to our nation, as was done by another distinguished NDA alumni, Sqn Ldr (later Wing Commander) Rakesh Sharma, AC, the first Indian in space way back in 1984. The pathbreaking accomplishment by these four stalwarts is a true testament of the excellent leadership skills and service training being imparted at NDA and it motivates us at the National Defence Academy, the cradle of leadership of the Indian Armed Forces, to remain steadfast to the cause of our great nation and making it \u2018Saare Jahaan se Accha\u2019 in every sense!\u201d Weeks before the general elections, IE 100, the list of the 100 most powerful Indians this year, maps the lay of the land \u2014 the BJP holding strong, the Opposition trying to hold it together.

"https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/apple-car-project-titan-history-9186428/": {"source": "Indian Express", "headline": "Apple car hits dead end: What happened to Steve Jobs\u2019s vision for EV?", "content": "After working on it for about 10 years, Apple has finally pulled the plug on its ambitious Apple Car project that could have taken the tech giant to a whole new level. The idea of an Apple Car goes back to the days of Steve Jobs, when he and a former senior VP had some chats about what their dream car would look like. But it was only in 2014 that Apple started to get serious about making an electric vehicle and launched a secret project called \u201cTitan\u201d. Since then, the project has been through a lot of ups and downs. In this article, we\u2019ll take you through the major milestones and challenges of theAppleCar journey, and what the company had in mind for its design and performance. Always ahead of the curve, some of the top executives at Apple were already brainstorming about the possibility of a self-driving Apple Car back way back in 2008. In an interview withBloomberg, Tony Fadell, a former senior vice president at the company, said that he and Jobs had a \u201ccouple of walks\u201d where they asked each other hypothetical questions about their ideal car. \u201cIf we were to build a car, what would we build? What would a dashboard be? And what would this be? What would seats be? How would you fuel it or power it?\u201d he said in the interview. Fadell also pointed out that phones and cars have a lot in common, as they both have batteries, a computer, a motor, and a mechanical structure, just like the iPhone. So it made sense for a company like Apple to venture into the car business. Even back then Apple\u2019s goal was to build a self-driving car. \u201cBut the hard stuff is really on the connectivity and how cars could be self-driving.\u201d Jobs decided not to go ahead with the project, partly because the auto industry was in a bad shape in 2008 (remember the recession?). The vision that Jobs and Fadell had discussed came back to life in 2014, when Apple launched a secret project called \u201cTitan\u201d to create an electric vehicle. According to aWSJreport, Apple assigned hundreds of employees to the project and started working on a design that looked like a minivan. But the report also said that Apple was still testing the waters and could scrap the idea of an EV altogether. Yep, right from the start, Apple was not sure about the outcome. But even if the project failed, the company figured it could still use the technologies developed by the project \u2013 such as advanced batteries and in-car electronics \u2013 in its core products like the iPhone and iPad. But the size of the project team and the senior people involved showed that the company was serious. The report also said that Apple wanted to make a big impact on the electric vehicle market, just like it did with the smartphone with its iPhone. The first time the Apple Car project hit a bump in the road was in 2016 when Apple decided to change gears and split it into two tracks. One track, which would be the priority, would focus on building self-driving car software. The other would take the back seat and focus on building the car itself. According to aBloombergreport, Apple hired Dan Dodge, the founder of QNX and one of the top experts in car software, to lead the development of the software. The plan was to license the software to car makers like Volkswagen and Ford, and to launch it by 2020. Until 2017, all we had were reports and leaks about Project Titan. But then, Apple CEO Tim Cook broke his silence and spoke publicly for the first time about the company\u2019s work in autonomous vehicles. While Cook did not explicitly mention \u201cApple Car\u201d nor reveal any details, he did say that self-driving cars, electric cars, and ride-sharing companies are going to shake up the auto industry. He hinted that Apple wanted to be part of this revolution, saying that the company is focusing on \u201cautonomous systems.\u201d Project Titan went quiet for a while, until 2019, when Apple made a surprising move and acquired Drive.ai, a struggling startup that was about to lay off staff and shut down. The company confirmed toThe Vergethat it bought Drive.ai, likely hiring dozens of its engineers to work on Project Titan. The first concrete date for the production of the Apple Car came out in 2020, when aReutersreport citing people familiar with the matter said that Apple was aiming for 2024 to produce a passenger vehicle. This vehicle could include its own breakthrough battery technology that would have a long-range and be \u201cradically\u201d cheaper than other batteries. TheReutersreport above also speculated that Apple could partner with another car manufacturer to produce the Apple Car. Cut to 2021 and Hyundai\u2019s Kia seemed like the most solid candidate for this. The deal was nearly finalised, according to aCNBCreport. But not long after, Hyundai confirmed that had indeed been in talks with Apple, but the deal had fallen through. The report speculated that Hyundai was worried about becoming a mere contract manufacturer for Apple, likeFoxconn. 2022 brought in another setback withBloombergreporting that Apple had scaled back its self-driving car plans, and had postponed the launch date to 2026. The reason? Apple realised that its vision of a fully autonomous vehicle, without a steering wheel or pedals, was not feasible with the technology of the time. Instead, Apple decided to focus on developing a Tesla-like self-driving system, that would still require human intervention and only support full autonomy on highways. After years of setbacks, Apple finally pulled the plug on its car project. On February 27, 2024, Apple announced to its 2,000 employees working on the project that it was shutting it down. Yep, the project had grown from the \u201cseveral hundred\u201d in 2014 as mentioned above to a couple of thousand employees, as Apple tried to tackle the complex and multidisciplinary challenges of building a car. It\u2019s been decided that the project will begin winding down and the team would be shifted to the artificial intelligence division spearheaded by executive John Giannandrea. These employees would focus on advancing generative AI instead. While the news does come as a shocker especially considering how long Apple has been working on the project, it came as a relief to investors \u2013 apparent from the climbing shares after the news broke. Besides the focus on generative AI, another potential reason for Apple shutting down Project Titan could be the slowing growth in EV sales in the United States. The lack of charging infrastructure has apparently pushed buyers to go for hybrid vehicles over all-electric ones there.

{"source": "Indian Express", "headline": "Shreyas Talpade made a massive change to his life after surviving heart attack at 48: \u2018Family, then health, and only then work\u2019", "content": "ActorShreyas Talpadeis all set to return to the big screen with his upcoming Marathi film Hee Anokhi Gaath, directed by Mahesh Manjrekar. This is the actor\u2019s first film after he suffered an almost fatal heart attack on December 17, 2023, at the age of 48. Two months after thecardiac arrest, the actor says he is now recovering and while he\u2019ll take \u201cfour to six months to fully recover,\u201d he has already started shooting a film but is \u201ctaking it very slow\u201d. In this interview withindianexpress.comShreyas opens up about experiencing the fear of \u201closing life in a split second\u201d that fateful day as he was rushed to the hospital by his wife Deepti. He also got candid about how he is now a man of \u201cchanged priorities\u201d amid what he calls his \u201csecond chance\u201d at life, and helping his wife come out of the trauma she\u2019s gone through during his treatment.   A post shared by ZeeStudios (@zeestudiosmarathi) \u201cTill the 14th of December I was a man obsessed with work. I have been working non-stop technically for the past 30 years or so. I was just focusing on my career and that was about it. We keep saying that we try to spend quality time with our family but that doesn\u2019t happen, your priority is work and you are running after that,\u201d confesses Shreyas who lived with chronic stress all his life since he made his acting debut in 2002. He says, \u201cPost that (heart attack) obviously the priorities have changed. Now my priority is my family, my health, and then comes work. So I feel that if you have to be here for a longer time then you have to take it easy. It is like the story of the hare and the tortoise. What I have learnt is that the tortoise goes at its own pace, consistently, slowly, one step at a time, that is all that matters. There are times when the hare keeps running ahead and then getting tired and keep resting, but I don\u2019t think it is a sustainable way of doing things. I don\u2019t think it works like that\u2026 You take it slow, take it easy, because there are other more important things in life that are happening around you, especially your family, your child growing up. So what happens to all those things?\u201d   A post shared by Deepti Shreyas Talpade (@deeptitalpade) Recounting the day he collapsed due to heart attack and the stressful period he and his family went through when he was receiving treatment at the hospital, Shreyas says those experiences have left him a changed man. He shared, \u201cIn that scenario I felt that this is technically a second life, a second opportunity that not many people get, and I wouldn\u2019t like to abuse it. So I am just taking it easy for now. Luckily this film came, which helped me to get out of the atmosphere that was building up in the house or wherever I go. But at the same time I want to make sure that I take good care of my health, or rather take better care of my health. I used to think that probably I was taking good care but clearly that wasn\u2019t really enough. The perception and priority has changed now, apart from that I am obviously thankful to God. Whatever happened, I am thankful to my wife for whatever she did that night.\u201d Two months since the fateful day, Shreyas is still recovering. While he has returned to work, he confesses that he\u2019s \u201cgoing slow\u201d. He says about his family, \u201cI am still recovering physically but it is more important for me to be there with her for her to recover mentally, it takes time to get out of the trauma. It is going to take some time. That\u2019s how I look at it and I would like to tell people, please don\u2019t take your health for granted because it doesn\u2019t work like that. It would take one split second for me to die. There was nothing I could do at that time.\u201d   A post shared by Shreyas Talpade (@shreyastalpade27) Shreyas accepts that he was scared for his life.\u00a0\u201cWe hear so many stories, so many incidents (of people losing their lives). I am really taking it slow. I have just started shoot, I am completing a film with two days of work left. They are also taking it slow for me. I am doing just what is needed. This will obviously go on for some time till I fully recover, which will take about four to six months. Post that the doctors have said that I can resume work and become \u2018more normal\u2019. But having said that, my priorities have changed now and they\u2019ll remain the way they are,\u201d Shreyas concludes. Click for more updates and latestBollywood newsalong withEntertainment updates.

Express", "headline": "Article 370 box office collection day 6: Yami Gautam-starrer maintains steady streak, mints Rs 32.55 crore", "content": "After a strong opening weekend, the Yami Gautam and Priyamani-starrer Article 370 has maintained a steady performance at the box office during weekdays. According to industry tracker Sacnilk, the film\u2019s nett collection on Wednesday amounted to Rs 3.10 crore, consistent with its Monday and Tuesday earnings, bringing its total domestic collection to Rs 32.55 crore. Article 370 made a promising debut, earning Rs 5.9 crore on its opening day. It witnessed an increase over the weekend, with collections of Rs 7.4 crore and Rs 9.6 crore on Saturday and Sunday respectively. However, it faced a decline on Monday, experiencing a drop of over 66 percent with collections amounting to Rs 3.25 crore.The film has since maintained a steady streak at the box office. Released alongside Vidyut Jammwal\u2019s Crakk, Article 370 has maintained its dominance over its competitor since their releases. While Crakk has amassed Rs 11.5 crore, Article 370 has surpassed it with Rs 32.55 crore. It is expected to maintain its lead for another week as it will face stiff competition from Ajay Devgn\u2019s horror drama Shaitaan, set to release in cinemas on March 8. Co-produced by Yami Gautam\u2019s husband, Aditya Dhar, Article 370 delves into the Prime Minister\u2019s decision to revoke the special status granted toJammuand Kashmir. The film has sparked debates, with some labeling it as propaganda. In a recent interview with News18, Priyamani addressed the same and said, \u201cSome people are going to say, \u2018Oh, this is raising awareness. People need to know these stories.\u2019 And then, there\u2019s always going to be a section that will say, \u2018This is absolutely propaganda.\u2019 When we took on this film or when we decided that we wanted to be a part of this film, I think the main reason was that we wanted to tell people, \u2018Listen there\u2019s something like this which has gone down in history and not many people know about it\u2019. I\u2019m sure people knew about it but they didn\u2019t know what people went through, what steps were taken to see to it that this mission was a success.\u201d Click for more updates and latestBollywood newsalong withEntertainment updates.

"Manjummel Boys movie review: Soubin Shahir, Sreenath Bhasi\u2019s chilling survival thriller asserts that hope is a good thing and no good thing ever dies", "content": "\u201cManithar unarndhukolla ithu manitha kaadhal alla! Athaiyum thaandi punithamanathu\u2026(This is no mortal love for humans to understand! This is beyond that, pure\u2026)\u201d echoes twice inManjummel Boys\u2019 trailer. An iconic dialogue from Santhana Bharathi\u2019s Kamal Haasan-starrer Gunaa (1991), which is recited by the male lead (Kamal) to convey his unwavering love to his female counterpart (Roshini), the deliberate decision to use this dialogue in Manjummel Boys\u2019 trailer initially appeared intriguing. But upon watching director Chidambaram\u2019s survival thriller, it becomes evident that no other dialogue can fully capture the soul of Manjummel Boys. Boasting a star-studded cast including Soubin Shahir, Sreenath Bhasi, Balu Varghese, Ganapathy, and Jean Paul Lal, among others, Manjummel Boys too is a film about unwavering love; not a romantic one though, but one grounded in camaraderie among a group of friends from a small locality called Manjummel in Ernakulam district of Kerala. At the same time, the film is also about hope, resilience and perseverance, and the fact that it is based on a true story makes it even more impactful. Set in 2006, a group of 10 happy-go-lucky young men, among whom a few earn a livelihood through odd jobs, embark on a dream trip to Kodaikanal, Tamil Nadu. Led by the group\u2019s elder, Kuttan (Soubin Shahir), they explore the lengths and breadths of the hill town with youthful exuberance and absolutely no inhibitions. Towards the end of their trip, Sudheesh (Deepak Parambol) realises they overlooked a major tourist attraction \u2014 the Guna caves (Devil\u2019s Kitchen) where Kamal\u2019s Gunaa was shot. Upon reaching, they realise that the real cave is sealed off. \u201cCourageously\u201d, they trespass the gates and begin exploring its depths. In a sudden turn of events, Subash (Sreenath Bhasi) falls into one of the deepest pits in the cave, leaving the others in panic. Despite attempts to seek help, locals and police offer no assistance, as \u201cnone of the 13 people who fell into the Devil\u2019s Kitchen previously have returned alive, and their bodies remain unrecovered\u201d. The remainder of the film focuses on the nine men\u2019s determined efforts to save their friend. One of the initial draws to Manjummel Boys is its restrained approach to depicting the era. Unlike many recent Malayalam films, such as Tovino Thomas\u2019Anweshippin Kandethum, which often inundate viewers with excessive period details like old film posters, Manjummel Boys uses only what\u2019s necessary to convey the setting. From the red bus, which traversed the Manjummel route until recently, to the characters\u2019 attire, the car they travel in, the absence of mobile phones and the presence of photographers at tourist spots, etc, the film effectively establishes the period without overwhelming audiences. Manjummel Boys captivates viewers with a suspenseful event at the start itself, setting the tone for what follows. As the story progresses, each character is introduced naturally, without unnecessary embellishments or artificial buildup. The first act is dedicated to laying the groundwork, highlighting the rapport among the characters, their surroundings and their anticipation for the upcoming trip. However, these scenes fail to fully engage due to a lack of compelling moments that would leave one wanting more. The plainness becomes somewhat monotonous over time, as it continually circles back to the boys without much happening. Nevertheless, the film gains momentum once the boys reach Kodaikanal. Here, too, Chidambaram steers away from conventional portrayals and avoids clich\u00e9d settings, offering a fresh experience. He maintains focus on the boys and their conversations, ensuring they aren\u2019t just a vehicle for showcasing youthfulness while also keeping the mood upbeat. Once they reach the Guna caves, the mood slowly shifts, and this transition is also natural, not imposed. The film, here, bids farewell to its earlier cheerfulness, slowing down to capture each moment and allowing the eerie ambience to seep in. The boys\u2019 impromptu entry into the cave\u2019s restricted area is handled delicately, effectively conveying both the characters\u2019 emotions and the impending horror. From this juncture, composer Sushin Shyam elevates the film with compelling background tracks, skillfully evoking a spectrum of emotions, complementing cinematographer Shyju Khalid\u2019s spectacular visuals. The way Subash\u2019s fall into the pit and his friends\u2019 reaction are depicted, along with the appearance of the film\u2019s title around the same time, deserves special commendation for its avoidance of melodrama and its focus on confusion, horror and panic. As the story progresses, the filmmaker ensures that the narrative explores multiple facets rather than dwelling on one aspect. For those who grew up watching Bharathan\u2019s classic survival drama Malootty (1990), the terrifying nature of being trapped in a pit, surrounded by helplessness and hopelessness, is well understood. In Manjummel Boys, Chidambaram skillfully evokes these emotions in viewers through carefully crafted moments that encapsulate the boys\u2019 emotions, the officials\u2019 demeanour and the locals\u2019 fear. By juxtaposing visuals from the boys\u2019 childhood with current events, Chidambaram adds depth, further enriching the atmosphere. Through a chilling dream sequence where Subash pleads for help looking up at a memory, Manjummel Boys spectacularly emphasises his impuissance while conveying his hope that a light will come from the above, echoing their driver Prasad\u2019s (Khalid Rahman) earlier words defining God, and saving him from the well of death. Amidst all these favourable factors, Manjummel Boys fails to capitalise on moments that could provide a significant high. While the interval block, which holds great significance in thrillers for maintaining audience engagement, passes quickly at a bleak point, Sudheesh\u2019s sudden burst of emotions, upon realising what happened quite some time after the actual event, also misses the mark. While Sushin does his best to amplify the visuals and the masterful world created by production designer Ajayan Chalissery, many moments here lack impact and, unfortunately, end up feeling mundane. Except for a few instances, such as when Kuttan volunteers to enter the cave and the tug-of-war reference towards the end, Manjummel Boys\u2019 attempts to create tension often fall short due to somewhat slapdash writing by Chidambaram. Nevertheless, the technical team skillfully elevates the film from the depths of Guna cave. Sushin Shyam, Ajayan Chalissery and Shyju Khalid, akin to formidable forces, have dedicated their all to Manjummel Boys, ensuring a spectacular viewing experience. Sushin\u2019s meticulous and well-crafted tracks uplift the film even during moments of lull, while each of Shyju\u2019s frames resembles a painting, fully capturing the ethos of the setting. Ajayan Chalissery\u2019s world-building, both above and below ground, is breathtaking. With scrupulous attention to detail, the production design of Manjummel Boys stands among the finest in Malayalam cinema history. The film\u2019s sound design also deserves recognition. Despite their characters initially appearing carefree, the actors deliver splendid performances, seamlessly transitioning through a range of emotions that enhance the film\u2019s overall beauty. Even amidst a reduced presence in the second half, Sreenath Bhasi shines as Subash, delivering a stellar performance that captures both the character\u2019s exuberance and vulnerability. He particularly excels in dream sequences and Subash\u2019s moments of trauma. Equally impressive is Soubin\u2019s portrayal of the team leader, skillfully delving into the character\u2019s emotions and bringing out the best in the role. Balu Varghese, Ganapathy, Jean Paul Lal, Khalid Rahman and Chandu Salimkumar also excel in their respective roles. Despite its shortcomings, Chidambaram\u2019s film can indeed be seen as a powerful tribute to the real Manjummel Boys and their determined efforts to save their dear one.

review: Don Palathara is an expert in exploring and exposing the different shades of human behaviour. \u201cEvery edit is a lie,\u201d cinema legend Jean-Luc Godard famously said once. In Don Palathara\u2019s movies, we seldom come across a single character that undergoes edits or refinement. It appears as if each person is depicted in the most raw and unfiltered manner possible. They aren\u2019t necessarily good or bad people; they can be both. Or, better to say that they are brutally and unapologetically themselves. The filmmaker\u2019s latest drama, Family, which premiered at the 52nd International Film Festival of Rotterdam (IFFR) and was recently screened at the 28th International Film Festival of Kerala (IFFK), too is a testament to this. Set in a quaint hamlet perched atop a hillock in the captivating landscapes of Idukki district, Family serves as an in-depth examination of the individuals in the community leading unassuming lives and also the closely-knit society they collectively form, where boundaries and personal spaces are nonexistent. The people, mostly following Christianity, are so interconnected that even the minutest events in their lives become common knowledge among all. Sony(Vinay Forrt) is the community\u2019s reliable go-to person for a myriad of tasks. Whether it involves rescuing a stranded cow from a well, tutoring children or imparting \u201cwisdom\u201d to a misbehaving teenage boy, residents approach him for all sorts of matters. Sony also derives satisfaction from being a \u201cgood Samaritan\u201d and volunteers to aid any family in the area, regardless of the scale of their needs. In contrast to many others in the locality, Sony doesn\u2019t adhere to regressive ideologies. In short, he stands out as an exceptionally good person in his community. While others blindly follow the religious teachings of the church, Sony\u2019s overt open-mindedness prompts one to ponder if there\u2019s more beneath the surface of his helpful demeanour. In a brilliantly composed and shot scene within a house, Family unveils a shocking revelation about Sony. As the man of the household watches TV in the living room, the camera peers through a nearby open door, revealing Sony providing tutoring to a teenage girl. Only Sony is visible through the doorway, sitting across from the girl behind a wall. In the midst of the lesson, Sony stands up and approaches the girl, leaving us with the unsettling image of the father casually watching TV while the nearby door remains open, revealing Sony\u2019s empty seat. This moment exposes what Sony does behind open doors. This pivotal moment shocks us, prompting us to reconsider and reassess Sony\u2019s previously perceived \u201camazing rapport\u201d with kids. Slowly, it becomes apparent that he is a paedophile. In the initial sequence, we learn that a leopard is prowling in the area, and now we realise that it symbolises the child-preying predator on the loose here. Towards the end, the sole shot featuring the leopard involves two little kids, not adults, spotting the big cat, further underlining this. The girl is not the only one facing abuse from Sony. He is depicted as being \u201cvery close\u201d with one of his relatives too. In a chilling scene, they both are riding on Sony\u2019s bike and after some time he parks it near a hillock. Walking away from the camera towards the mountain\u2019s summit, Sony\u2019s hand rests on the kid\u2019s shoulders, leaving us no choice but to witness him leading the child to an abandoned location for preying, reminiscent of a leopard\u2019s behaviour. Sony\u2019s brother, Nobi (Mathew Thomas), also maintains a noticeable distance from him. When Sony offers to teach Nobi how to ride a bike, Nobi promptly declines with clear irritation, suggesting that he, too, has faced similar abuses from Sony growing up. While the documentary Mea Maxima Culpa: Silence in the House of God (2012) and the biographical drama Spotlight (2015), among many other works, shed light on the sexual abuse of minors by the clergy, Family, penned by Sherin Catherine and Don, goes one step further and explores how the church and a conservative, close-knit society \u201cfacilitate\u201d child sex abuse and how they create a \u201csafe space\u201d for pedophiles by maintaining a hostile environment that rarely allows children the opportunity to speak up and silencing those who express doubts about the occurrence of such incidents in their surroundings. In a particular instance, Sony\u2019s relative Rani (Divya Prabha) finds him with the young girl in the storeroom of their house while everyone else is in the living room. Initially shaken, Sony deceives Rani about the reasons for their solitary presence. Subsequently, when Rani confides in the girl\u2019s mother, the latter commends Sony as an amazing person. Later, their relative, a nun, confronts Rani for \u201cspreading such stories\u201d and admonishes her from doing so \u201cfor God\u2019s sake\u201d. Sony\u2019s questionable actions don\u2019t stop here. Following her father\u2019s suicide, a young woman in the area is left in severe trauma, with only her mother and sister for support. Sony enters the scene as a helping hand but quickly ensnares her in a romantic relationship. When his family disapproves of this relationship, he shrewdly ends it by gaslighting her. Nevertheless, the film also skillfully reveals glimpses of his reprehensible behaviour here. Both the family and the church, or society at large, steadfastly support Sony throughout these events, not harbouring even the slightest hint of doubt. To \u201cpurify\u201d his soul once again, they arrange for him to attend a church retreat, where he is reassured that \u201cGod will forgive your sins\u201d, yet again highlighting the cunning nature of such institutions. Towards the end, the church priest even requests Sony to join the local school as a teacher for 10th-grade students, akin to placing a leopard in a haven of prey. One of the beauties of Family is its adept use of wide and long shots, employing little to no close-ups, emphasising how the entire society is a part of all this. By cleverly toning down the on-screen colours, Don Palathara also accentuates the monotonous nature of people. Simultaneously, the filmmaker ensures that Family is not loud at any moment; it unfolds in a very subdued, non-flashy and uneventful manner, much like most of our lives. Vinay Forrt, who consistently delivers an A-game performance when handling nuanced characters, excels in Family as well. His remarkable understanding of the character, coupled with additional layers of nuances, while effectively conveying why he is regarded as \u201cdear\u201d to all, makes Sony one of the most chilling antagonists in Malayalam cinema. Simultaneously, all the other actors, especially Divya Prabha, Mathew Thomas and Nilja K Baby, deliver standout performances in their respective roles. While cinematographer Jaleel Badusha\u2019s contribution emerges as one of the major strengths of Family, Basil CJ\u2019s music enhances the overall brilliance of the film. Family also serves as a testament to Don\u2019s editing prowess, highlighting the excellence a visionary filmmaker can achieve when well-versed in editing.

"Indian Express", "headline": "Einstein and the Bomb movie review: A poor attempt by Netflix to piggyback on the popularity of Oppenheimer", "content": "With the production values of a hastily made Saturday Night Live sketch and all the visual splendour of a Sora video, Netflix\u2019s Einstein and the Bomb fails \u2014 in every possible way \u2014 to provide any actual insight about the renowned theoretical physicist. Charitably speaking, the hour-long docudrama is a blatant attempt to piggyback on the popularity ofChristopher Nolan\u2019s Oppenheimer, without bothering to match the blockbuster film\u2019s ambition or complexity in a meaningful manner. Einstein and the Bomb combines extensive dramatic reenactments and a smattering of archival footage, but withzero expert input. The film begins with the claim that every word in it was either spoken or written by Einstein himself. Everything that we see is supposedly hard fact. It\u2019s fairly reasonable, therefore, for the viewer to expect the film to uncover interesting details about his life and personality, especially since so much of it has been documented. But some of the creative choices here, regardless of the resources available, are simply bizarre to behold. Also read \u2013Alexander \u2013 The Making of a God review: Netflix\u2019s historical docudrama is indistinguishable from a daytime soap Einstein and the Bomb traces Einstein\u2019s journey as a political refugee in England to his stint at Princeton University in the United States. This is when he crossed paths with J Robert Oppenheimer (in a made-up scene) in Nolan\u2019s film. You\u2019d perhaps be a little dismayed to learn that Oppenheimer doesn\u2019t make an appearance in Einstein and the Bomb at all. In fact, he isn\u2019t even mentioned. The movie does, however, address Einstein\u2019s tangential role in the creation of the world\u2019s first atomic bombs, as well as the guilt that he was subsequently tortured by in the days following America\u2019s bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The problem is that it doesn\u2019t view this as incidental complicity, but as an innocent mistake. Aidan McArdle plays Einstein in the reenactments, although director Anthony Philipson seems to be under the impression that makeup is more important than an actor\u2019s performance. In virtually every frame, McArdle looks like he\u2019s wearing an Albert Einstein mask \u2014 not the plastic kind you\u2019d get at a toy shop, but the sort of mask that Buffalo Bill carves from the skin of his victims in Silence of the Lambs. It\u2019s massively distracting, as if the stilted dialogue wasn\u2019t already damaging the film. The first 30-odd minutes of the movie are devoted entirely to Einstein\u2019s ouster from Germany, where his vocal opposition ofAdolf Hitler and the Nazi partypainted a target on his back. Einstein fled to England, where, likeTaylor Swiftduring the pandemic, he fully embraced a cottagecore aesthetic and lived in the countryside with two armed female guards for company. In the film, he spends this time regaling his companions about relativity \u2014 \u201can hour sitting on the park bench with a pretty girl feels like a minute, and a minute sitting on a hot stove feels like an hour\u201d \u2014 and also contemplating the potentially dangerous implications of his theories. Einstein describes himself as a \u2018militant pacifist\u2019. \u201cOrganised force,\u201d he says, \u201ccan only be opposed by organised force.\u201d And this is why he co-signed a letter addressed to the then-US President Franklin D Roosevelt, urging him to initiate a nuclear programme before the Nazis beat everybody to it. This was perhaps his biggest contribution to the creation of the atomic bombs; Einstein wasn\u2019t invited to join the Manhattan Project owing to his vocal politics. But the film doesn\u2019t exactly indict the Americans for what is generally considered to be awar crime, although, admittedly, Einstein and the Bomb underlines the fact that the Americans attacked Japanafterit was already clear that the war had been won. Speaking of pure evil, the film also recreates a speech that Einstein made at the Royal Albert Hall in 1933, denouncing Hitler\u2019s rise in the clearest of terms. Real footage of this speech exists, but Einstein and the Bomb chooses to use only about six seconds of it, as if it is actively trying to stay within the parameters of the fair use policy. To find a way around this invented obstacle \u2014 remember, it was probably impossible for Einstein and the Bomb to recreate the entire speech in a packed hall \u2014 the filmmakers take us backstage, where they take the \u2018jugaadu\u2019 approach by showing us Einstein\u2019s nervous rehearsals.

But then again, this isn\u2019t a student film, or one of those informative videos that play on a loop at museums, projected against an empty wall. It\u2019s a proper movie that Netflix has deemed worthy of a prominent spot on its already overpopulated homepage. This is prime real estate, the sort of spot that would typically be assigned to an actual Nolan film, as opposed to something that is merely riding on the coattails of one.

Thursday. The shares had hit the lower brand circuit on Wednesday to hit 406.15 apiece. This comes as payment aggregatorPaytmfinds itself at the receiving end to non-compliance and supervisory concerns, as per RBI. Paytm had recently reconstituted the company\u2019s board with induction of several key industry veterans after Vijay Shekhar Sharma had resigned as part time non-executive Chairman of Paytm Payments Bank Ltd. As per experts, the fall in share price indicates that Sharma\u2019s resignation has failed to soothe investors nerve. Paytm shares has hit the upper circuit on two consecutives sessions earlier. In January, RBI undertook regulatory action against the aggregator, barring it from accepting any fresh deposits, or top-ups in wallets, accounts, FASTags and other instruments from February end. The deadline was later extended to March 15. Paytm shares has rebounded during last couple of sessions to trade 20 percent above the 52-week low of Rs 318 hit on February 16. However, the stock is still around 50 percent below the January 31 closing price of Rs 761.20. \u201cWe expect Paytm to lose 5-7ppt of its 25 percent share in the payments industry, driven by loss of wallet (2-3ppt permanent loss) and the rest due to merchant/customer churn,\u201d brokerage firm UBS said. Morgan Stanley has maintained an \u2018equal-weight\u2019 call on the stock with a target price of Rs 555 while Goldman Sachs has a \u2018neutral\u2019 rating on the stock with a revised target price of Rs 450. Renowned brokerage firm Jefferies has discontinued its rating on Paytm after moving it to the list of \u2018non-rated\u2019 stocks.

April-December 2023", "content": "Foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows in India declined 13 per cent to USD 32.03 billion in April-December 2023, dragged down by lower infusion in computer hardware and software, telecom, auto, and pharma sectors, according to the latest government data. FDI inflows stood at USD 36.74 billion during the corresponding nine months of the preceding fiscal. Inflows during the October-December quarter of the current fiscal, however, rose by 18 per cent to USD 11.6 billion as against USD 9.83 billion during the same quarter of 2022-23. The total FDI \u2014 which includes equity inflows, reinvested earnings and other capital \u2014 declined by about 7 per cent to USD 51.5 billion during the period under review against USD 55.27 billion in April-December 2022, the data from the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) showed. During the nine-month period of this fiscal, FDI equity inflows decreased from major countries, including Singapore, the US, the UK, Cyprus and the UAE. Investments fell significantly from the Cayman Islands and Cyprus to USD 215 million and USD 796 million, respectively, during April-December 2023 as against the two comparative figures of USD 624 million and USD 1.15 billion recorded in the year-ago period. However, inflows increased from Mauritius, the Netherlands, Japan and Germany. Sectorally, inflows contracted in computer software and hardware, trading, services, telecommunication, automobile, pharma and chemicals. In contrast, construction (infrastructure) activities, development and power sectors registered growth in inflows. State-wise, Maharashtra received the highest inflow of USD 12.1 billion during the period. It was USD 10.76 billion in the same period a year ago. Overseas capital inflows in Karnataka plunged to USD 3.6 billion in April-December 2023 from USD 8.77 billion in the same period of previous fiscal year. Other states/Union Territories where FDI dipped during the period under review includedDelhi, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Rajasthan and Haryana. The inflow, however, recorded a positive growth in Gujarat, Telangana, and Jharkhand. An official has earlier stated that hardening interest rates globally and worsening geopolitical situation impacted FDI inflows. FDI equity inflows into India declined 22 per cent to USD 46 billion in 2022-23. Weeks before the general elections, IE 100, the list of the 100 most powerful Indians this year, maps the lay of the land \u2014 the BJP holding strong, the Opposition trying to hold it together.

steepest fall in 9 months amid Red Sea crisis", "content": "India\u2019s non-oil exports in January registered a 9 per cent decline in January compared to the previous month as outbound shipments to Europe and the US slowed further amid the Red Sea shipping route crisis, an official data from Commerce Ministry showed on Wednesday. This was the steepest month-on-month decline in exports in the non-oil category in nine months as global shipping lines were forced to a longer sea route through the Cape of Good Hope amid sustained attacks by the Houthi forces along the crucial shipping routes. As far as oil exports are concerned, the impact of the Red Sea troubles on India\u2019s overall petroleum product exports was limited as exporters shifted cargoes to various other geographies. While petroleum exports to Europe registered a sharp 22 per cent decline, exports to Singapore, Australia, Indonesia, Japan, Oman, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh, jumped. The primary impact of the shipping disruption was visible in India\u2019s exports to the Netherlands which is home to the biggest port in Europe \u2013 Port of Rotterdam. Electronic goods exports to the Netherlands slipped 37 per cent while drugs and pharmaceutical exports declined by 18 per cent. Engineering goods exports also slipped 15 per cent compared to the previous month. Led by a decline in electronic goods and drugs and pharma shipments, exports to the UK also slipped 12 per cent in January compared to December. However, demand in the UK has also slipped as Britain\u2019s economy fell into a recession in the second half of 2023. India\u2019s total exports for the US slipped 6.32 per cent to $12.55 billion in January. Engineering goods exports slipped 12.61 per cent in January compared to December, Gems And Jewellery exports declined 10.83 per cent. Marine Products exports slipped 19.87 per cent and Meat, Dairy And Poultry Products also fell 11.54 per cent. The United Nation\u2019s trade and development body, UNCTAD, had earlier raised alarm over the disruption in global trade due to chaos in the Red Sea shipping route stating that the ongoing crisis would particularly hurt developing nations such as India. \u201cDeveloping countries are particularly vulnerable to these disruptions, and UNCTAD remains vigilant in monitoring the evolving situation,\u201d UNCTAD\u2019s head of trade logistics, Jan Hoffmann had said. While current container rates are approximately half of the peak seen during theCOVID-19crisis, it will take time for the higher prices to hit consumers, with the full impact expected within a year, the UN trade body further said. The Suez Canal, a critical waterway connecting the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea, handled approximately 12 per cent to 15 per cent of global trade in 2023, UNCTAD said, estimating that the trade volume going through the Suez Canal decreased by 42 per cent over the last two months.

asks MFs to limit inflows in small, mid-cap funds amid a buildup of \u2018froth\u2019", "content": "Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI) has written to mutual fund houses to take measures to protect the interest of investors of small and mid-cap schemes, which have seen heavy inflows in the recent past. Small and mid-cap funds have seen a surge in inflows from investors led by higher-than-expected performance of companies in these segments. Many analysts have raised concerns over the valuation of small and mid-cap stocks which poses risks for investors. \u201cIn the context of froth building up in the small and mid-cap segments of the market and the continuing flows in the small and mid-cap schemes of mutual funds, trustees, in consultation with the Unitholder Protection Committee of the AMCs (Asset Management Companies), shall ensure that a policy is put in place to protect the interest of all investors,\u201d AMFI wrote to its members in a letter written on February 27. AMFI, the mutual fund body, said that AMCs and fund managers should take appropriate and proactive measures to safeguard investors, including but not limited to moderating inflows, portfolio rebalancing, among others. \u201cSteps to ensure that investors are protected from the first mover advantage of redeeming investors,\u201d the letter said. Further, AMFI directed that the policy regarding this should be approved by trustees and disclosed on each mutual funds\u2019 website within 21 days from February 27. In the past six months, the Nifty Smallcap 100 index has risen 33 per cent and Nifty Midcap 100 has surged 24.38 per cent. The growth in both the indices is much higher than the 14 per cent growth seen in the benchmark Nifty 50 in a similar period. Between August 2023 and January 2024, small-cap funds have seen net inflows of Rs 22,252.14 crore while mid-cap funds have witnessed inflows of Rs 13,042.1 crore, according to AMFI data. On the other hand, large cap funds have seen net inflows of around Rs 1,577.04 crore in the same period. Earlier this week, Kotak Mutual Fund in a note to investors said that it has limited the inflows in its small cap funds from March 4, 2024. \u201cSystematic Investment Plan (SIP), or Systematic Transfer Plan (STP), or such other special products in Kotak Small Cap Fund would be limited to Rs 25,000 per PAN (first holder/Guardian) per month for daily, weekly, monthly and quarterly frequencies,\u201d Kotak MF said. In case of lumpsum investments, inflows would be limited to Rs 2,00,000 per PAN per month. Last year, Nippon India Mutual Fund had also stopped accepting lumpsum investments in its small cap funds. The city of Dwarka, Lord Krishna's ancient abode, is considered a significant pilgrimage site and is believed to have been submerged under the sea after Krishna's death. Scholars have suggested different locations for the exact site of Dwarka, and excavations on land and underwater have revealed artefacts from different time periods, but the search for the submerged city continues.

"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/supreme-court-patanjali-advertising-ban-9186029/": {"source": "Indian Express", "headline": "Why did the Supreme Court ban Baba Ramdev\u2019s Patanjali from advertising its products?", "content": "The Supreme Court Tuesday (February 27) came down heavily on Baba Ramdev\u2019s Patanjali Ayurved for publishing misleading advertisements, and banned it from marketing its products until further orders are passed. A bench comprising Justices Hima Kohli and Ahsannudin Amanullahtook Patanjali to task for publishing advertisementsthat directly attacked allopathic medicines despite giving an assurance to the court in November 2023 that \u201cno casual statements claiming medicinal efficacy or against any system of medicine will be released to the media in any form.\u201d The Indian Medical Association (IMA) filed a petition at the apex court in August 2022 after Patanjali published an advertisement titled \u201cMISCONCEPTIONS SPREAD BY ALLOPATHY: SAVE YOURSELF AND THE COUNTRY FROM THE MISCONCEPTIONS SPREAD BY PHARMA AND MEDICAL INDUSTRY.\u201d The petition details other instances where Ramdev called allopathy a \u201cstupid and bankrupt science\u201d, and made claims about allopathic medicine being responsible forCovid-19deaths. The IMA also accused Patanjali of contributing to vaccine hesitancy during the pandemic by spreading false rumours. The IMA claims that these attacks against modern medicine through a \u201ccontinuous, systematic, and unabated spread of misinformation\u201d come alongside Patanjali\u2019s own efforts to make false and unfounded claims about curing certain diseases through the use of Patanjali products. The IMA claimed that the advertisement was in direct violation of the Drugs & Other Magical Remedies Act, 1954 (DOMA), and the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 (CPA). The publishing of false and misleading advertisements is an offence under both statutes. Under Section 4 of the DOMA, there is a prohibition against publishing misleading advertisements relating to a drug. This is described as an advertisement which \u201cdirectly or indirectly gives a false impression regarding the true character of the drug\u201d, \u201cmakes a false claim for the drug\u201d, or \u201cis otherwise false or misleading in any material particular.\u201d Publishing a misleading advertisement under the DOMA is punishable with up to six months imprisonment, and/or a fine for the first offence. On the second offence, the period of imprisonment can extend to one year. The IMA has also highlighted the Memorandum of Understanding signed by the Ministry of AYUSH and the Advertising Standards Council of India in January 2017. AYUSH, which is responsible for developing and setting medical standards for traditional medicine, agreed to identify misleading advertisements that may be in violation of the DOMA, and send complaints to the Council for review. Despite this, the IMA claims that Patanjali has continued to disregard the law and violate the DOMA. Section 89 of the CPA contains even more stringent punishments for false or misleading advertisements. It states: \u201cAny manufacturer or service provider who causes a false or misleading advertisement to be made which is prejudicial to the interest of consumers shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years and with fine which may extend to ten lakh rupees; and for every subsequent offence, be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to five years and with fine which may extend to fifty lakh rupees.\u201d The CPA also provides the definition for a \u201cmisleading advertisement\u201d. It includes advertisements which give a false description of the product or service, partakes in unfair trade practices, deliberately conceals important information, or is likely to mislead the consumer about the nature, substance, quantity or quality of the product or service. The Supreme Court has warned Patanjali regarding their false and misleading advertising on multiple occasions now, with February 27 marking an escalation in the court\u2019s approach. The case was first heard substantively on November 21 last year. Justice Amanullah orally warned Patanjali against claiming that their products can completely \u201ccure\u201d diseases, and threatened to impose a cost of Rs 1 crore on every product for which such a claim is made. The court\u2019s focus has decidedly been on the subject of curbing misleading advertisements as they have clearly stated that they do not wish to enter the \u201cAllopathy v. Ayurveda\u201d debate. Senior Advocate Sajan Poovayya, representing Patanjali, assured the court that there \u201cshall not be any violation of any law(s), especially relating to advertising or branding of products manufactured and marketed by it and, further, that no casual statements claiming medicinal efficacy or against any system of medicine will be released to the media in any form\u201d, as per the order passed on November 21. Additional Solicitor General K M Nataraj, representing the central government, also agreed to look into the allegations and suggest measures in response. On January 15, the court received an anonymous letter addressed to the Chief Justice of India and Justice Amanullah regarding the continued publishing of false and misleading advertisements. In the next hearing on February 27, the court noted that Patanjali continued to publish advertisements with claims that they could provide \u201cpermanent relief\u201d for diseases and that their products were superior to conventional medicines. After asking the government for details of their consultation with other ministries so far, an irate Justice Amanullah stated: \u201cThe entire country has been taken for a ride! For two years you wait when the Drugs Act says this is prohibited?\u201d Deeming Patanjali\u2019s actions \u201cunacceptable\u201d the court overrode the requests to allow ads without \u201cadjectives\u201d, and placed a blanket ban until further orders on any further advertising or branding of Patanjali medicinal products, and warned the company once again against making adverse statements regarding conventional medicine on any media forum. The case will be heard again on March 19. Weeks before the general elections, IE 100, the list of the 100 most powerful Indians this year, maps the lay of the land \u2014 the BJP holding strong, the Opposition trying to hold it together.

year? Why does a leap year not come every four years?", "content": "The second month of the new year will have one extra day \u2014 2024 is a leap year. While it is generally known that a leap year occurs every four years, what exactly is a leap year? Why was the need felt for it? Is every fourth year a leap year? We explain. What is a leap year? A leap year has 366 days in a year as opposed to the regular 365 days. The extra day is added to February, the shortest month of the year, as February 29. Why was a leap year introduced? One year in a solar calendar reflects one round the Earth makes around the Sun. The Earth takes 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes and 46 seconds to revolve around the Sun. The length of a normal year is thus rounded off to 365 days. To account for the extra time, rounded up to six hours, 24 hours \u2014 one full day \u2014 are added to every fourth year. If this had not been done, crop cycles and seasons would start occurring at different times of the year gradually, leading to confusion. When was the leap year introduced? AsThe Indian Expresshas explained earlier, the leap year was introduced by scholars engaged by Julius Caesar in 46 BC, and made more precise from 12 AD. The Julian calendar had a year that was usually 365 days long, with a 366th day added once every four years. According to the website of the Royal Museums Greenwich, the Islamic calendar Al-Hijra also has an extra day added to the 12th month Zul Hijja on leap years. However, even this method was not error-free, because the six hours used for calculation are still different from the actual 5 hours, 48 minutes and 46 seconds, making the calendar year slightly longer than the solar year. Thus, in the 16th century, it was calculated that the calendar years until then had accumulated 10 extra days. In 1582, Pope Gregory XIII ordered a drastic compensation by dropping 10 days from the calendar, and October 4 that year was followed by October 15 the very next day. Why does a leap year not come every four years? Pope Gregory XIII\u2019s one-time action was obviously not enough to solve the problem. Thus, it was decided that some leap years \u2014 about one leap year every century \u2014 would be dropped to manage the extra day. The years chosen for this were those ending with 00. However, dropping the leap year from all years ending with 00 would again throw the calculation out of whack. Finally, in the Gregorian calendar, the 00 years that were divisible by 400 ended up as leap years. Thus, 1900 was not a leap year, but 2000 was. Weeks before the general elections, IE 100, the list of the 100 most powerful Indians this year, maps the lay of the land \u2014 the BJP holding strong, the Opposition trying to hold it together.

Google-Reddit AI deal foretells future of content licensing for LLMs", "content": "Google and Reddit have signed a$60 million dealthat will give the Internet search giant real-time access to the data of one of the world\u2019s most visited social media and content-sharing platforms. Google will use this data for its artificial intelligence (AI) offerings. Reddit is headed to a public listing in the coming weeks, and an infusion of cash at this time could boost investor confidence. AndGoogle\u2019s AI system has come under fire \u2014 in both the US and India \u2014 and the company is looking to make its offerings more reliable. The deal underlines the value of user-generated content on the Internet, especially for Generative AI (GenAI) platforms like Google\u2019sGeminiand OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. It also points to the complexities of training large language models (LLMs) when they can potentially infringe on the intellectual property rights of content producers online \u2014 and the reason why such content licensing deals may be crucial. Google will get access to Reddit\u2019s data application programming interface (API), which delivers real-time, structured, unique content from the social media platform. \u201cWith the Reddit Data API, Google will have efficient and structured access to fresher information, as well as enhanced signals that will help us better understand Reddit content and display, train on, and otherwise use it in the most accurate and relevant ways,\u201d Google said in a blog post. Google needs access to as much user-generated content as possible to make its foundational model more reliable and accurate. Widespread criticism of responses generated by Gemini has increased the urgency for the company to get its act together, as the likes of OpenAI come to have an increasingly greater say in the future of how users access online services. India, in response to the question \u201cIs Modi a fascist?\u201d Gemini said that the Prime Minister has been \u201caccused of implementing policies some experts have characterised as fascist\u201d, which include the \u201cBJP\u2019s Hindu nationalist ideology, its crackdown on dissent, and its use of violence against religious minorities\u201d. After the IT Ministry threatened to issue a show-cause notice for the \u201cillegal and problematic\u201d responses, Google said it had addressed the issue, and was working to improve the system. The company had earlier apologised for \u201cinaccuracies in some historical image generation depictions\u201d after criticism that Gemini had depicted white figures (like the founding fathers of the US) or groups like Nazi-era German soldiers as people of colour. The New York Timessued OpenAI andMicrosoft, the creators of ChatGPT, and other popular AI platforms last year, citing \u201cunlawful\u201d use of copyrighted content. The NYT said in its lawsuit that the companies were scraping original content from the publisher to build their models and manufacture responses. The NYT lawsuit has reignited the debate on the ownership of online content and whether GenAI platforms are infringing on the intellectual property (IP) rights of organisations like news publications that put out significant amounts of updated and mostly accurate information on the Internet \u2014 the kind of data that GenAI platforms can really benefit from. The responses that AI platforms such as ChatGPT and Gemini generate rest on the bedrock of millions of pieces of textual content that creators, including news publishers, have uploaded online. The music business \u2014 which is among the most sensitive towards IP rights \u2014 has also been pushing back on the use of AI in the industry. Universal Music Group has asked streaming services such as Spotify to stop developers from scraping its material to train AI bots in making new songs. Copyright laws in countries around the world, including India, need drastic reimagining in the era of AI. In India, creative works are regulated by The Copyright Act of 1957, which defines an \u201cauthor\u201d (among other things) \u201cin relation to any literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work which is computer-generated, the person who causes the work to be created\u201d. However, this definition does not take into account the fact that AI systems do not generate information on their own; they are only as good as the base dataset on which they are trained. And the base dataset is built out of copyrighted work produced by other authors.

Raman Effect, which CV Raman won the Nobel for", "content": "In 1986, the Government of India, under then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, designated February 28 asNational Science Dayto commemorate the announcement of the discovery of the \u201cRaman Effect\u201d. This was the discovery which won physicist Sir CV Raman his Nobel Prize in 1930. Conducting a deceptively simple experiment, Raman discovered that when a stream of light passes through a liquid, a fraction of the light scattered by the liquid is of a different colour. This discovery was immediately recognised as groundbreaking in the scientific community, being the subject of over 700 papers in the first seven years after its announcement. What is the \u201cRaman Effect\u201d? Why is it so important? Most importantly, who was the man behind this momentous discovery? Raman was born to a family of Sanskrit scholars in Trichy (present-day Tiruchirapalli) in the Madras Presidency in 1888. At the age of only 16, He received a BA degree from Presidency College in Madras, and was placed first in his class. While studying for his MA degree, at the age of 18, he got published in the Philosophical Magazine: this was the first research paper ever published by Presidency College. Due to his ill health, he was unable to travel abroad for further education. Thus, in 1907, he got married and settled down in Calcutta as an assistant accountant general. While still a full-time civil servant, Raman began after-hours research at the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science (IACS). Raman raised the profile of IACS, doing some award-winning research as well as conducting public demonstrations with charisma. At the age of 29, he finally resigned from his civil services job and took up a professorship in Presidency College, Calcutta. By 1921, CV Raman had gained a solid reputation as a top scientific mind both in India and in the West. That year, he made his first journey to England. It was on the return journey that Raman would make an observation that would change his life and science forever. While passing through the Mediterranean Sea, Raman was most fascinated by the sea\u2019s deep blue colour. Dissatisfied with the then-accepted answer (\u201cthe colour of the sea was just a reflection of the colour of the sky\u201d), his curious mind delved deeper. He soon found out that the colour of the sea was the result of the scattering of sunlight by the water molecules. Fascinated by the phenomenon of light-scattering, Raman and his collaborators in Calcutta began to conduct extensive scientific experiments on the matter \u2013 experiments that would eventually lead to his eponymous discovery. Simply put, the Raman Effect refers to the phenomenon in which when a stream of light passes through a liquid, a fraction of the light scattered by the liquid is of a different colour. This happens due to the change in the wavelength of light that occurs when a light beam is deflected by molecules. In general, when light interacts with an object, it can either be reflected, refracted or transmitted. One of the things that scientists look at when light is scattered is if the particle it interacts with is able to change its energy. The Raman Effect is when the change in the energy of the light is affected by the vibrations of the molecule or material under observation, leading to a change in its wavelength. In their first report to Nature, titled \u201cA New Type of Secondary Radiation,\u201d CV Raman and co-author KS Krishnan wrote that 60 different liquids had been studied, and all showed the same result \u2013 a tiny fraction of scattered light had a different colour than the incident light. \u201cIt is thus,\u201d Raman said, \u201ca phenomenon whose universal nature has to be recognised.\u201d Raman would go on to verify these observations using a spectroscope, publishing the quantitative findings in the Indian Journal of Physics on March 31, 1928. CV Raman\u2019s discovery took the world by storm as it had deep implications far beyond Raman\u2019s original intentions. As Raman himself remarked in his 1930 Nobel Prize speech, \u201cThe character of the scattered radiations enables us to obtain an insight into the ultimate structure of the scattering substance.\u201d For quantum theory, in vogue in the scientific world at the time, Raman\u2019s discovery was crucial. The discovery would also find its use in chemistry, giving birth to a new field known as Raman spectroscopy as a basic analytical tool to conduct nondestructive chemical analysis for both organic and inorganic compounds. With the invention of lasers and the capabilities to concentrate much stronger beams of light, the uses of Raman spectroscopy have only ballooned over time. Today, this method has a wide variety of applications, from studying art and other objects of cultural importance in a non-invasive fashion to finding drugs hidden inside luggage at customs.

"headline": "Who was Santhan, Rajiv Gandhi assassination convict who died less than 2 years after his release?", "content": "Days after an order was issued to send him home to Sri Lanka,Santhan alias T Suthenthiraraja, one of the seven released convictsin the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case, died in Chennai. He was 55. Who was Santhan, and what was his role in Rajiv Gandhi\u2019s assassination? How did he get involved in that conspiracy? Santhan died at the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital inChennaion Wednesday. He had been admitted to the hospital last month and was undergoing treatment for non-alcoholic liver disease. According to a doctor who was treating him, he suffered a cardiac arrest on Wednesday and breathed his last at 7.50 am. When did he come to India, and how long did he spend in jail? A Sri Lankan citizen, Santhan was accused No. 2 in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case. He was charged for his active association with Sivarasan, considered the mastermind behind the assassination. According to CBI case files, Santhan came to Tamil Nadu with Sivarasan in April 1991. The chargesheet described him as a member of the LTTE\u2019s intelligence wing who was close to Sivarasan. In February 1988, Sivarasan suggested that Santhan continue his studies in what was then Madras (now Chennai), and in February 1990, he secured admission at the Madras Institute of Engineering Technology, where his expenses were met by the LTTE. On May 21, 1991, Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated. In 1998, a TADA court sentenced 26 of the 41 accused to death, including 12 who had died in the blast or during the investigation. In May 1999, the Supreme Court freed 19 of them, while upholding the death sentences of Murugan, Santhan, Perarivalan, and Nalini, and commuting the death sentences of Payas, Ravichandran, and Jayakumar to life. Santhan spent over 32 years incarcerated, including a decade in solitary confinement. He was also a death row prisoner for 22 years until the Supreme Court commuted the death sentences of four into life in 2014. When Santhan, along with six others, were finally released in November 2022, it was the first time he stepped out of the prison complex in 32 years, as he had not had a single parole. The release, however, did not last long. While three convicts \u2013 Perarivalan, Nalini, and Ravichandran \u2013 were released, four Sri Lankan nationals \u2013 Santhan, Jayakumar, Robert Payas, and Murugan \u2013 were sent to a special prison camp for foreigners in Trichy. It was meant as a transit point before their repatriation. However, as the state government and the Union government dragged their feet on paperwork for their repatriation, all four wrote several petitions stating they were denied basic freedoms under humanitarian grounds. There were also complaints of authorities denying medical help. Among the four sheltered at Trichy prison, Santhan was the only Sri Lankan national who wanted to return to own country. After a long delay, on Friday, the Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO) in Chennai issued an order to deport Santhan to Sri Lanka. Murugan, Payas, and Jayakumar were seeking to go to Europe to join their immediate relatives who migrated there during the war in Sri Lanka. While Santhan had declined to meet this reporter multiple times since 2012, Perarivalan, who spent nearly three decades in prison with Santhan, recalled him as a man \u201cwho lived in his own world\u201d. Santhan never spoke to anyone in prison. Overtly religious, he used to regularly perform puja and rituals at a temple inside Vellore prison. \u201cHe would sit in the prison temple for almost the entire day,\u201d said Perarivalan in an earlier interview. Where is his family now? Santhan\u2019s family lives in Udupiddy in the Jaffna district in northern Sri Lanka. His father died in 2013 and his mother, Maheshwari, 78, lives with her younger son Sudhakaran. After Santhan left home, the family was displaced in 1995, and returned to their small two-room house only in 2010. In an extensive conversation withThe Indian Expressrecently, Sudhakaran, who is 16 years younger to his brother, said he met Santhan twice after 1991 \u2013 once in 2014 and then in 2017. According to Sudhakaran, Santhan left home to study in London in 1990. \u201cWhen he was arrested, he had a ticket to fly to London three days later, which I read in the book of the late Special Investigation Team chief K Raghothaman,\u201d he said. \u201cOur life was always caught up in trouble. Be it from the LTTE or the Sri Lankan Army; we were victims of the war. After his arrest, he used to write letters for some time, but then we lost touch. Once he said that he reduced communication fearing that it would be trouble for us. There was extreme poverty in the period when he left for London. Not even once did we have food three times a day. I remember how my mother used to skip food for us. After the war ended and we managed an income, my mother continued to skip food for her son in prison,\u201d Sudhakaran said. The first visitor Santhan had after his arrest in 1991 was Sudhakaran, in 2014. \u201cI was six when he left home in 1990. We waited for him at the visitors\u2019 room at the Vellore Central Prison. The moment he entered the room, I cried. Seeing me, he was surprised. He asked, \u2018Thambiyaa?\u2019 (Isn\u2019t it my brother?). I said, \u2018aamam\u2019 (yes). He said he wouldn\u2019t have met me if he knew that it was me. He said he wanted to see me only back at home, not in prison. A Q-branch official stood there, consoled me. He told me myAnnan(elder brother) was mentally upset. Exchanging a few words, he hurried back. He reminded me that I should inform him in advance next time as he has to do pujas at the temple inside, and that he will finish that early to meet me,\u201d Sudhakaran said. For Maheshwari, Santhan\u2019s mother, life was all about war, miseries, and concerns about her son trapped in a \u201clifelong curse\u201d. \u201cI remember the day he left us. It was Sithirai Parvam (an auspicious day falls in the Tamil month of Chithirai, in April). I was fasting that day. He had puttu (a dish made of ground rice and coconut) and left home. He was helpless. War was brewing. He said he would go to London and take his sister and brother too,\u201d she toldThe Indian Expressafter Santhan\u2019s release in 2022. Weeks before the general elections, IE 100, the list of the 100 most powerful Indians this year, maps the lay of the land \u2014 the BJP holding strong, the Opposition trying to hold it together.

"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-law/what-is-the-karnataka-temple-bill-controversry-9184880/": {"source": "Indian Express", "headline": "Row over Karnataka temple Bill: What changes it proposed, how other states manage temple revenues", "content": "Karnataka temple Bill controversy: The Karnataka government\u2019s attempt to tweak the law that governs taxation ofHindu temples was stymied in the Legislative Council, where the primary Opposition, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), holds a majority. The Karnataka Hindu Religious Institutions and Charitable Endowments (Amendment) Bill, 2024 was introduced in the Legislative Assembly on February 19 and passed on February 22. However, it was rejected two days later in the Legislative Council. The Bill was meant to amend multiple provisions in the Karnataka Hindu Religious Institutions and Charitable Endowments Act, 1997. The first and the most contentious was that it intended to divert \u201c10% of the gross income of institutions whose gross annual income exceeds Rs 1 crore\u201d to a common pool for the maintenance of temples, instead of the existing \u201c10% of the net income of institutions whose gross annual income exceeds Rs 10 lakh\u201d. Net income is calculated based on the profits of the temple after accounting for its expenses, whereas gross income simply refers to the total amount of money the temple makes. In addition, the Bill dedicated 5% of the income of institutions earning between Rs 10 lakh and Rs 1 crore to the common pool, changing the previous income bracket from Rs 5 lakh to Rs 10 lakh. The common fund pool was created by theBJPgovernment in 2011, by amending the 1997 Act. If the recent amendments had been passed, they would have generated an extra Rs 60 crore, from 87 temples with incomes of over Rs 1 crore and 311 temples with income over Rs 10 lakh. Section 19 of the Act lists the purposes for which the common fund may be utilised, including religious studies and propagation, temple maintenance, and other charitable causes. The Congress government had said the enhanced funds would be used to grant aid to lower income temples, provide terminal benefits to ailing priests, and provide scholarships to children from families of priests. What were the criticisms against the amendments? BJP leaders accused theSiddaramaiahgovernment of attempting to \u201crob\u201d temples and questioned why only Hindu temples were being targeted. BJP state president BY Vijayendra said \u201cThe question from crores of devotees is why is the government eyeing the incomes of Hindu temples when it is not interested in the revenue of other religions?\u201d Siddaramaiah, however, maintained that there \u201chas always been a mandate to create a common pool since the enactment of the Act in 1997 \u2026 The common pool is administered solely for religious purposes connected with the Hindu religion\u2026 and it will continue to be used for the same purposes.\u201d Did the Bill propose any other changes? Under Section 25 of the Act, temples and religious institutions are required to form a \u201ccommittee of management\u201d consisting of nine people, including a priest, at least one member of a Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe, two women, and one member of the locality of the institution. The Bill proposed to include, among the remaining four members, one person \u201cskilled in Vishwakarma hindu temple architecture and sculpture.\u201d The Bill also gave the Rajya Dharmika Parishat the power to appoint the chairman of these committees. The Rajya Dharmika Parishat is a body appointed by the state government that is empowered to make decisions on a variety of subjects related to religion. This includes religious disputes over practices and customs, whether a temple is a \u201ccomposite institution\u201d by allowing religious worship besides Hinduism, whether a temple is private, public or denominational, and whether a person is a hereditary trustee of a religious institution by virtue of succession. Finally, the Bill also required the state government to create district-level and state high-level committees to oversee infrastructural projects that can facilitate pilgrimage to temples making more than Rs 25 lakh annually. How is temple revenue handled in other states? Telangana\u2019s approach shares similarities with the Karnataka model. Under Section 70 of the Telangana Charitable and Hindu Religious Institutions and Endowments Act, 1987, the Commissioner in charge of administration of religious institutions can create a \u201cCommon Good Fund\u201d. Religious institutions making more that Rs 50,000 annually are required to pay 1.5% of their annual income to the state government. After the government is repaid for expenses it has incurred under the Telangana Act, the commissioner can direct the remaining funds to the Common Good Fund. These funds are utilised for the maintenance and renovations of temples, veda-pathasalas (religious schools) and for the establishment of new temples. Kerala employs an entirely different system, where temples are often managed by state-run Devaswom (temple) Boards. The state has five autonomous Devswom Boards that manage over 3,000 temples. These boards are run by nominees appointed by the ruling government, who are often politicians. Each Devaswom Board has abudgetallocated by the state government and is not required to share revenue figures. The state has also enacted separate laws for each Devaswom board (besides Travancore and Cochin which are governed by the same Act), which deal with the administration and management of temples under their aegis. Weeks before the general elections, IE 100, the list of the 100 most powerful Indians this year, maps the lay of the land \u2014 the BJP holding strong, the Opposition trying to hold it together.

Ranji Trophy games resulted in Shreyas Iyer and Ishan Kishan being dropped from BCCI\u2019s central contract list", "content": "In an unprecedented move, which will send a strong message to those skipping domestic cricket, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has dropped Shreyas Iyer and Ishan Kishan from the annual contract list. The decision comes after the two players refused to turn up for their domestic sides despite BCCI secretary Jay Shah sending a strongly-worded letter to all the contracted players to feature in domestic cricket. Hardik Pandya, another player who hasn\u2019t played any cricket since the World Cup, and was recovering from an ankle injury, though keeps his place in Grade A. It is understood that the call to drop both the players, who were integral part of the Indian team across all formats in 2023, was taken by the secretary after the selectors recommended so. Missing out on the central contract is significant for the both with the T20 World Cup to be played in three months\u2019 time. It is understood that the chances of the two making the cut for the event in the US and the Caribbean is bleak and could potentially have an impact on their immediate future with the national team. The contract snub comes at a crucial juncture for both the players, who were very much part of India\u2019s scheme of things, especially in white-ball cricket. The Indian Expressunderstands that even if Shreyas and Ishan return to the team later this year and fulfill the pro-rata criteria (minimum of 3 Tests or 8 ODIs or 10 T20Is within the contract cycle), they won\u2019t be considered for a contract. Instead, they would be paid only the match fee depending upon the format. Additionally, athletes who meet the criteria of playing a minimum of 3 Tests or 8 ODIs or 10 T20Is within the specified period will automatically be included in Grade C on a pro-rata basis.

But he hasn\u2019t reported to the NCA or the state unit, but continues to train alone. Under the circumstances, there was no chance for the BCCI to offer a central contract. Similarly with Shreyas, we went by the medical reports. The door is still open for them provided they play domestic cricket regularly,\u201d sources in the know told this paper. Shreyas in particular had a good outing at the World Cup in October-November, where he scored 468 runs, including two centuries and three fifties and was one of the stars. Though he was struggling in Tests, he was given a long rope, before being dropped mid-way through the ongoing series against England. As reported by this newspaper, though Shreyas reasoned back and groin pain for missing out on Ranji matches for Mumbai, the BCCI\u2019s medical team headed by Nitin Patel \u2014 the head of sports science at the National Cricket Academy \u2014 found no issues with his fitness. The middle-order batsman has been included in Mumbai\u2019s squad for the Ranji Trophy semi-final against Tamil Nadu beginning on Saturday. With regards to Ishan, there has been displeasure in the way he has gone about his break. Citing personal reasons, Ishan had asked for a break during the South Africa tour. While he was granted rest for the Test tour, sources close to the player revealed that he was unhappy about being constantly benched across formats. And since January, the wicketkeeper batsman has been training with Hardik Pandya and Krunal Pandya at Vadodara and has missed the entire Ranji campaign for Jharkhand. India\u2019s position on Ishan hasn\u2019t changed with head coachRahul Dravidclearly stating that for the player to be considered for selection, he has to play domestic cricket. Other than this, there were hardly any surprises in the list.  Kohli in Grade A+ Virat Kohli, who has been unavailable for selection because of personal reasons, has been retained in Grade A+, which shows the full backing of the BCCI and the selectors.

Iyer and Ishan Kishan after BCCI contract snub?", "content": "While both Shreyas Iyer and Ishan Kishan were kept out of the BCCI central contract list on Wednesday, they continue to be part of their Indian Premier League franchises, for whom they are star performers. They were retained by their respective teams before the auction, which shows that they are integral to the plans. IPL contracts for elite players are very lucrative, but missing out on a BCCI contract is a financial, as well as cricketing, setback. Additionally, athletes who meet the criteria of playing a minimum of 3 Tests or 8 ODIs or 10 T20Is within the specified period will automatically be included in Grade C on a pro-rata basis. For more details, click the link below \ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47https://t.co/IzRjzUUdel#TeamIndia \u2014 BCCI (@BCCI)February 28, 2024 If they are unable to play for the country, it denies them the chance to be in the spotlight. The IPL is held for only two months a year, and domestic cricket, though central to the development of players, doesn\u2019t attract as many eyeballs. It also provides a chance to other contenders to stake their claim and cement their spots in place of Iyer and Ishan. With the sort of competition for places in the Indian team, out of sight can often mean out of mind. With their omission from the contract list presumably a result of recommendation by the selection panel, the two players will most likely have to do something special in whatever cricket they play to put their names back in the reckoning. There are other areas also where Iyer and Ishan may miss out. A centrally-contracted player can make use of BCCI facilities, including the National Cricket Academy, as and when they want. This is significant when a cricketer is injured, out of the team or simply wants to work on his game or fitness. Those not among the elite group will have to go through their respective state units to avail the NCA facilities. A contracted player also has a comprehensive insurance cover. So if he misses out on the IPL due to an injury suffered while playing for India, as has been the case withMohammed Shamiafter his stellar performance in the 50-over World Cup, they will be compensated for the financial loss. The medical expenses too will be taken care of by the board. List of contracted players: Grade A+ (Rs 7 Crore):Rohit Sharma,Virat Kohli, Jasprit Bumrah andRavindra Jadeja. Grade A (Rs 5 crore):R Ashwin, Mohd. Shami, Mohd. Siraj,KL Rahul, Shubman Gill and Hardik Pandya. Grade B (Rs 3 crore):Surya Kumar Yadav,Rishabh Pant, Kuldeep Yadav,Axar Pateland Yashasvi Jaiswal. Grade C (Rs 1 crore):Rinku Singh, Tilak Verma, Ruturaj Gaekwad, Shardul Thakur,Shivam Dube,Ravi Bishnoi, Jitesh Sharma,Washington Sundar, Mukesh Kumar, Sanju Samson, Arshdeep Singh, KS Bharat, Prasidh Krishna,Avesh Khanand Rajat Patidar.

"https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/india-vs-england-kuldeep-yadav-to-be-played-ahead-of-axar-patel-in-tests-9186591/": {"source": "Indian Express", "headline": "India vs England: \u2018Insane hard work\u2019 ensures Kuldeep Yadav will have to be played ahead of Axar Patel in Tests", "content": "Former bowling coach Bharat Arun remembers a moment that then India head coach Ravi Shastri had with Kuldeep Yadav about his fitness. \u201cThis puppy fat you have na has to be melted away boss! I can\u2019t think of a single reason with improved fitness that you won\u2019t become a world-class Test bowler,\u201d Arun paraphrases Shastri\u2019s words from memory. Arun brings it up in the context of the \u201cinsane hard work\u201d that Kuldeep has put in since late 2021 from the moment he was sidelined due to a serious leg injury that needed surgery. \u201cIt seems rather silly to say this but that injury, I think, gave him no option but to get fitter. He had to do all the hard rehab work, shed himself of that puppy fat, to continue his dream of playing cricket. And he has obviously worked a lot on his bowling \u2013 that energy through the crease is a standout feature now. It allows him to increase pace without sacrificing turn, loop, drift,\u201d Arun tellsThe Indian Express. Super fielding from Sarfaraz Khan! \ud83e\udd2f \ud83d\udc4a@ImRainawould be proud of that catch as#TeamIndiacontinue to take wickets in the 4th Test \ud83d\ude4c#INDvsENG#IDFCFirstBankTestSeries#BazBowled#JioCinemaSportspic.twitter.com/sXRPTPgwZA \u2014 JioCinema (@JioCinema)February 25, 2024 It\u2019s also the reason why India will now have to play Kuldeep ahead ofAxar Patelin any Test they play. Especially, in the context of the pitches they are serving \u2013 not rank turners- where Axar the bowler is almost nullified, or at least his effectiveness vastly reduced. On such tracks, the comparison can be simplistically reduced to a battle between their stock balls. Axar\u2019s landing on a length and skidding on on a good day with a hint of turn has no chance against Kuldeep\u2019s wristy loopy offering with a bit more turn that has the potential to beat batsmen in flight, with dip and turn. Aligned with it, are his other variations. Axar was one of India\u2019s most valuable batsmen in the home Test series against Australia, but of late, Kuldeep the batsman has fought doggedly, putting a big price on his wicket. One returns to Arun and the perception floating around then was that during his stint, Kuldeep wasn\u2019t played that frequently as he wanted the spinner to bowl faster. Arun laughs. The Kuldeep Yadav effect\ud83e\ude84\ud83d\udc4c Crawley is left deceived by the#TeamIndiaspinner\u2019s brilliance with the ball \ud83d\udc4f#IDFCFirstBankTestSeries#BazBowled#JioCinemaSports#INDvENGpic.twitter.com/T5IE3Fwd3l \u2014 JioCinema (@JioCinema)February 25, 2024 \u201cAny bowler can bowl quicker \u2013 that was never the point. It had to be done without sacrificing turn, loop and dip. And it was always about the energy through the crease. The ultimate result is a visible increase in pace. Not the other way around. Not going there and firing the ball. None of us are idiots! It was about being patient and working hard. \u201cHow do you do that? Fitness certainly is a factor to bowl in Tests with that kind of energy. We always knew Kuldeep can deliver: Who can forget the ball he bowled in the 2015 World Cup to Babar Azam! How to sustain that through longer spells? When your release point\u2019s hand position is precise, you have a quicker arm speed. All the spinner\u2019s nuances can come through the wrist position. Now look at him, quicker arm-speed, that bustle through the crease, near-perfect hand position at release, and it\u2019s all going in the direction it ought to go \u2013 towards the batsman at the other end. With better fitness, his basics (of bowling action) taken care of, he is now actively channeling all his energy at the other end, trying to beat the man there,\u201d Arun says. It wasn\u2019t an easy journey, though. In IPL 2021, Kuldeep didn\u2019t feature in a single game forKolkata Knight Ridersand left the bubble after suffering a knee injury, which forced him to go for surgery. Former spinner and selector Sunil Joshi had spoken to this newspaper about his work with Kuldeep since 2021-22 after his return from surgery in particular. \u201cI got his delivery stride shorter, front arm better, arm-speed better, got him to rip more revolutions on the ball \u2026 Ravi Shastri asked me, \u2018Sunil, what have you done with Kuldeep?\u2019 I said, \u2018Ravi bhai, I have not done anything special. If you look at Kuldeep 2.0, his front arm is going toward the target, his bowling arm is towards the target, he is running towards the target. Shorter stride, there is a free follow-through, he has got quicker through the air.\u201d A stint withDelhi CapitalsunderRicky Ponting\u2019s coaching helped. Regular matches came his way. More encouragement came viaRishabh Pant, his IPL captain. And now, he has flourished more underRohit Sharma\u2019s captaincy. \u201cTu aisa daalega toh bowling nahi doonga (If you bowl like this, I will take you off),\u201d Rohit would shout from slip during a game last year when he felt Kuldeep was slipping into a flatter trajectory. Rohit can cajole; he also can be a firm guiding hand. Both traits have helped Kuldeep. In the ongoing series against England, Rohit has been spending a lot of time with Kuldeep in the nets, with long chats on his batting \u2013 about his bat-flow and trigger movements. Everything is syncing up nicely now.  He might not be able to play the last Test in Dharamsala owing to the conditions that may prompt India to go with a pace-heavy composition, but in the bigger picture, the future looks bright. As Arun puts it: \u201cHe is not even 30 yet, his best years as a Test spinner are ahead.\u201d   ", "embeddings": [-0.0721668228507042, 0.04376064985990524, -0.013937568292021751,

coach Ravi Shastri\u2019s advice to Ishan Kishan and Shreyas Iyer: \u2018Chin up and come back even stronger. I have no doubt you\u2019ll conquer once again\u2019", "content": "Former India coach Ravi Shastri is of the opinion that out of favour stars Ishan Kishan and Shreyas Iyer will eventually find their way to the Indian team. Both cricketers on Wednesday was dropped from the Board of Control for Cricket in India\u2019s (BCCI) annual contract list. \u201cIn the game of cricket, comebacks define the spirit. Chin-up, @ShreyasIyer15 and @ishankishan51! Dig deep, face challenges, and come back even stronger. Your past achievements speak volumes, and I have no doubt you\u2019ll conquer once again,\u201d Shastri posted on X after the news of Ishan and Shreyas\u2019s snub broke. The news on Wednesday comes after the two players refused to turn up for their domestic sides despite BCCI secretary Jay Shah sending a strongly-worded letter to all the contracted players to feature in domestic cricket. In a separate post, Shastri lauded the BCCI on creating a separate category for fast bowling contracts. \u201cBig applause to@BCCIand@JayShahfor the game-changing move with \u2018fast bowling\u2019 contracts. A crucial step in gearing up for Down Under later this year. The emphasis on Test Cricket and Domestic Cricket is a powerful message, setting the right tone for the future of our beloved sport!\u201d Missing out on the central contracts for both Kishan and Iyer couldn\u2019t have come at a more crucial juncture in their careers, with a T20 World Cup less than four months away. The two had been part of India\u2019s ODI World Cup squad last year, with Iyer having scored 500 plus runs in a campaign that saw India reach the final, only to lose to Australia. The right-handedMumbaibatter had only last month donned India\u2019s Test kit inHyderabadagainst England before he was dropped from the national side owing to a string of poor outings in the shortest format of the game. As reported byThe Indian Expressearlier, the case against Iyer\u2019s exclusion was made stronger when earlier this month Iyer missed out on playing for Mumbai in Ranji Trophy quarterfinal, citing back and groin pain. Only for the BCCI medical team to suggest that they found nothing wrong with his fitness. Kishan on the other hand, has been out of India\u2019s squad since the tour of South Africa, which he had left midway through \u2013 requesting a break owing tomental fatigue.The swashbuckling keeper-batter has since not featured in the domestic circuit and played his first professional game since then on Tuesday in the DY Patil T20 Cup \u2013 as did Hardik Pandya since his World Cup injury \u2013 for RBI, scoring 19 off 12 deliveries. Those in the know of things have told this daily that even if Shreyas and Ishan return to the team later this year and fulfill the pro-rata criteria (minimum of 3 Tests or 8 ODIs or 10 T20Is within the contract cycle), they won\u2019t be considered for a contract. Instead, they would be paid only the match fee depending upon the format.

{"source": "Indian Express", "headline": "New chasemasters: Why Shubman Gill and Dhruv Jurel are a throwback to MS Dhoni-Yuvraj Singh", "content": "Only 32 times in 158 instances have India completed a successful chases in their Test history. Chennai 1999, Pune 2017, Chennai 2021, Bangalore 2004, 2005, 1987, or most recently Hyderabad 2024; there have been many instances of India failing to handle the fourth-inning pressure at home. On Monday, on a flaking pitch where the ball turned and occasionally kept low, India was struggling. Chasing 192, they were 120/5. Ranchi 2024 seemed like a repeat of the same old story. However, inShubman GillandDhruv JurelIndia would discover a pair ofpotential chase-masters. Gill likes fourth innings \u2014 in 10 knocks, he averages 44. To contextualise,Rohit Sharmaaverages only 32 and has scored a half-century fewer than Gill, having featured in eight more innings.Steve Smith, arguably the best batsman of his generation, averages 29. It shows how devious a pursuit it is. Gill did post a foundation-laying 91 in a historic Brisbane chase. But this was a sterner challenge. At the Gabba, he was en route to stardom, but not a star yet. Thus, less baggage. For much of that innings, he had the stability of Cheteshwar Pujara at the other end. Here, he was playing the senior hand. The chemistry, but not particularly their methods, whipped up memories ofYuvraj Singhand MS Dhoni when India had just begun to crack the chase code in ODIs. Yuvraj was insouciant, unflustered to a fault, as Jurel was. Dhoni was the puzzle-solver, bending his methods to suit the situation. Gill, like Dhoni, often would just meander along with singles and twos. He controlled his instinct to go for the big hit. Dhoni, in his finisher avatar, struck sixes and fours only if those were necessary. Unlike his dasher role at the start of the career. \u201cThis would probably go down as my only innings where I didn\u2019t hit a boundary, like a four, after scoring a fifty,\u201d Gill said after the match. \u201cBut you have to see the situation and have to play the situation sometimes,\u201d he added. Play the situation. That\u2019s what the best finishers, across formats, do. Jurel too played the situation. He was fresh from his 90 in the first innings, but this was different. He could have counter-attacked. But he resisted and just knuckled down, soaking the pressure and manipulating the gaps for singles, a busy rather than a bustling player. Jurel nudged and nurdled, with pliant wrists; Gill often came down the track and extended his defensive push for a single. They barely got together in the middle; hardly advised each other. They inhabited their own spaces and didn\u2019t infringe into the other. They mostly exchanged glances. Glares of assurance, nods of guarantee. Like Dhoni and Yuvraj would. Perhaps, one of them, likely to be Jurel, would have hummed a song too. The mechanics, undoubtedly, differ with formats. But both contain challenges and hazards of their own. The scoreboard pressure remains, but in different ways. A batsman doesn\u2019t, often, have the pressure of overhauling a total in half as many balls. He could often play out one bowler and target another. There would be restrictions on setting fields too. But pitches in Test matches, on the fourth and fifth days especially, would be far more treacherous than their T20 or ODI counterparts would ever be. In Asia, there would be variable bounce, excessive turn. One has to possess the skill and mind to play the situation. India\u2019s batsmen were seldom short-fused for skills, but in the relentless heat of the situation, they often lost their heads. TheChennai1999 meltdown is a classic case study. Soon afterSachin Tendulkardeparted, clutching his tattered back, India lost three wickets for four runs. Twelve years further back, India were 155 for 5, chasing 221 before folding up 16 short against the same opposition. In recent times, three of their last four losses at home have come when batting last. There have been several near-escapes too. Like Mohali 2010. Ranchi 2024 was unlike Mohali 2010, despite the mini-collapse. Perhaps it was a sign of India overcoming another historic burden. At some point in time,Virat Kohli, who averages 47 in the fourth innings, would arrive to add another layer of solidity to the line-up. India vs England,Hyderabad2024 The target of 231 was stiff but not unconquerable. At one point, India were cruising at 63 for 2, before stuttering to 119 for 7, against the wiles of debutant left-arm spinner Tom Hartley. Despite some lower-order resistance, India fell 28 runs short. India vs England, Edgbaston 2018 India were chasing 194 and seemed on course until Virat Kohli perished, 53 runs short of the target. India added just 22 more runs and were left to rue a missed opportunity. The destroyer was Ben Stokes, with a four-wicket haul. India vs Sri Lanka, Galle, 2015 Set a target of 176 on a raging turner, India seldom got going and folded up for a meagre 112. India\u2019s lone source of resistance wasAjinkya Rahane\u2019s 36. But that was not enough to douse the slow-fire of Rangana Herath. India vs Pakistan,Bangalore2005 The hosts were always looking to draw the match. The target of 383 was too tall an order. OpenersGautam GambhirandVirender Sehwagput on 87, but the rest combusted. In the space of 48 runs, they lost five wickets, from where they never recovered. India vs Pakistan, Chennai 1998 The most heartbreaking of them all. Sachin Tendulkar scored one of his greatest hundreds, battling back pain, Saqlain Mushtaq, Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis, but departed with the target only 17 runs away. The rest is painful history.

Navgire\u2019s move to opening slot pays off for UP Warriorz as they defeat Mumbai Indians", "content": "Kiran Navgire had a lacklustre 2023 WPL. In the Senior Women\u2019s T20 Trophy that followed, she made just 88 runs in six games for Maharashtra. Yet, the UP Warriorz, in full faith of her big-hitting abilities, tweaked their lineup in the absence of regular opener Dinesh Vrinda to give Navgire a go at the top of the order in what looked like a challenging run chase against the Mumbai Indians on Wednesday. Whether a stroke of luck, or an inspired choice, it is fair to assume she has now cemented her spot. It had been a strikingly disappointing first innings for the UP Warriorz. 2 points in the \ud83d\udcbc@UPWarriorzrecord their first win of the#TATAWPL2024 courtesy some power hitting \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d Result \u25b6\ufe0f:https://t.co/jmTNrFZNfq#TATAWPL|#MIvUPWpic.twitter.com/vA2GbStrh5 \u2014 Women's Premier League (WPL) (@wplt20)February 28, 2024 Their limited, inexperienced, spin-heavy bowling lineup struggled to hit their spots despite a promising start and their misery was compounded by tragically sloppy fielding. But Navgire, alongside skipper Alyssa Healy, immediately put that in the rear-view mirror, hitting a blistering 94-run opening partnership to power their side to their first win of the season. Navgire was the aggressor-in-chief, taking the pressure off Healy. Her straight-bat front-foot play was overwhelming both pace and spin. She smashed five fours and a six in the powerplay to lead UP to 61/0 in the first six \u2013 the highest powerplay score this season. She helped herself to a 25-ball 50, and departed at 57 with six boundaries and four sixes. Even though Wednesday\u2019s innings came as an opener, Navgire\u2019s big-hitting ability, from ball one, makes her a potential candidate for the finisher role that India will be seeking someone to perform at this year\u2019s T20 World Cup. Lack of consistency had always been a niggling issue though, and more performances like these will keep her in the reckoning. Smashing it all across the park, Kiran Navgire has got off to a flying start \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25 Live \u2013https://t.co/B5aPe30OXX#TATAWPL#MIvUPWpic.twitter.com/D28SxJH1pb \u2014 Women's Premier League (WPL) (@wplt20)February 28, 2024 Once Navgire lost her wicket, there had been a bit of a wobble \u2013 Issy Wong scalped both Healy and Tahlia McGrath in the same over. But an aggressive partnership from Grace Harris and Deepti Sharma (desperate to prove herself as a batter having failed to do so in India colours recently) allowed them to round out the run chase with over three overs to spare. The duo did not let the boundaries dry up and kept the scorecard ticking; Harris\u2019 over-200 strike rate, despite arriving at a time the team was under pressure, will boost confidence in UP\u2019s middle order. Healy\u2019s side had already built a strong platform early in the first innings, keepingMumbai\u2013 who were without regular captain and middle-order enforcer Harmanpreet Kaur \u2013 down to 13/0 in the first four overs, and finding the timely wicket of Yastika Bhatia just as she had begun raining down boundaries. A soft dismissal and@UPWarriorzhave their first wicket! Yastika Bhatia is caught by Rajeshwari Gayakwad off Grace Harris's bowling.

Hayley Mathews was dropped thrice as she ploughed her way to a 47-ball 55. With only one seamer in use, their spinners failed to find the right length and leaked boundaries. They failed to capitalise on the fortune (and presence of mind of Sophie Ecclestone) of a mix up that led to Nat Sciver-Brunt being run out. They conceded boundaries from both misfields and overthrows. Their sloppiness took Mumbai to an above-par total of 162.  Navgire\u2019s blistering innings, ably supported by Healy, rendered that sloppiness irrelevant. But it would leave concerns the team will hope to address in the future. Brief Scores:Mumbai Indians: 161 for 6 in 20 overs (Hayley Matthews 55; Grace Harris 1/20) lost to UP Warriorz: 163 for 3 in 16.3 overs (Kiran Navgire 57; Issy Wong 2/30).

Delhi High Court partly sets aside CAT\u2019s decision on action against IRS officer Sameer Wankhede", "content": "While partly allowing the Centre\u2019s plea, the Delhi High Court set aside the direction of the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) on \u201cpassing a reasoned and speaking order\u201d before deciding to initiate action against Sameer Wankhede, the former\u00a0Mumbai zone chief\u00a0of the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), in connection with the 2021 Cordelia Cruise drug bust case. In the February 27 order, a division bench of Justice Rekha Palli and Justice Girish Kathpalia, however, said it does not find \u201cany infirmity\u201d in CAT\u2019s direction which said Wankhede will be \u201cgranted an\u00a0opportunity of personal hearing\u201d before authorities decide to initiate any action against him. \u201cHowever, the directions of the learned Tribunal requiring the respondent no. 1 (Ministry of Finance) and 5 (Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs)\u00a0to pass a reasoned and speaking order before taking a decision to initiate action against the applicant (Wankhede) is wholly unsustainable and is required to be set aside,\u201d the bench said. The bench agreed with the Centre\u2019s argument and observed that the \u201crequirement of passing a reasoned and speaking order before initiating any action against\u201d Wankhede would be contrary to the scheme of Central Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules. \u201cFor the aforesaid reasons, the writ petition is, partly allowed by setting aside the directions issued in para 9 of the impugned order dated 21.08.2023 insofar as it directs the respondent no. 1 and 5 to pass a reasoned and speaking order after granting a personal hearing to the applicant (Wankhede) i.e., before taking a decision as to whether any action is required to be initiated against him,\u201d the bench said disposing of Centre\u2019s plea. The bench, however, clarified that its order will not come in the way of Wankhede in challenging the CAT order if so advised. On August 21, 2023, the CAT noted a\u00a0Special Enquiry Team (SET), constituted by the NCB, was formed to look into the allegations in the manner in which Wankhede had conducted the raid/investigation into the Cordelia Cruise case. In its order, the\u00a0Tribunal had noted that SET was headed by\u00a0Gyaneshwar Singh, who was the deputy director general, Northern Region (NCB), when the case was registered. Wankhede had challenged the SET report arguing that\u00a0Singh \u201cactively supervised\u201d the investigation in the case registered by the NCB, and therefore Singh could not have been a \u201cjudge of his own cause\u201d and thus the SET report should be quashed. The Tribunal took note of the submissions of the respondents before it \u2014 the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Home Affairs, NCB, Singh, and the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) \u2014 that the SET report is \u201cpreliminary in nature\u201d and they will have to take an independent decision regarding the action to be taken against Wankhede. The Tribunal had also directed that Wankhede be granted a \u201cpersonal hearing\u201d before action is initiated against him based on the SET report and the \u201cdecision so taken shall be communicated to him by passing a reasoned and speaking order\u201d. Trinamool Congress leader Shahjahan Sheikh, wanted for land grab and sexual harassment cases, was arrested by West Bengal Police from Minakhan area. He had been on the run since January 5 when his supporters attacked ED officials. The Calcutta High Court had directed that he could be arrested by CBI, ED, or state police. Protests against his aides have caused tension between TMC and BJP.

{"source": "Indian Express", "headline": "Two months since Amitabh Kant relief package for stalled legacy projects, first registry yet to take place in Noida", "content": "Two months after the Uttar Pradesh government issued the order to implement the Amitabh Kant committee report on legacy stalled projects, Gautam Buddha Nagar district is yet to register even one flat as part of the said plan. Noida Authority officials said that the process of registration of flats will begin March 1, when around 100 flats will be registered in sector-77 (Express Zenith) after setting up registration camps in collaboration with the Sub-registrar office. Under the package, the registration of flats can begin only when the builder pays 25% of the outstanding amount (land dues) within 60 days. The scheme provides for a two-year zero period relief, taking into account Covid period, to the builders, among others. Under the zero-period waiver clause, interest and penal interest will not be levied on the builder for two years, and the installments will be shifted beyond it. Using this formula, land dues of the builders will be cut by 20%. Data available with the Noida Authority shows that out of 57 builders \u2014 this does not include projects in NCLT/Courts \u2014 roped in under the plan, the developer of 35 projects have given the consent for the scheme. Out of this, only six builders have paid the required 25% of the dues. Data shows that on the basis of these consents, the authority will collect dues of Rs 2,210 crore; out of this, builders have to pay Rs 553 crore in the next 60 days. A total of six builders have paid around Rs 30 crore so far. Officials said that this consent will pave the way for the registration of a total of 13,639 flats in around two years and 3,412 flats in the next few months. The para 21 (viii) of UP government order, dated 21.12.2023, states that \u201cIt must be ensured that the registration of all complete flats and other flats, where buyers are residing after Occupancy Certificate (OC) or without OC, should be completed in three months.\u201d Out of these 35 projects, M/s Omaxe Buildwell Ltd. owes the highest \u2014 Rs 505 crore \u2014 to the Authority. Other builders are Greatvalue Projects (Rs 197 crore in dues), Prateek Realtors (Rs 105 crore), Sikka Infrastructure (Rs 208 crore), Pan Realtors (Rs 151 crore), Sunworld Residency (Rs 169 crore), Mahagun Moderne (Rs 77 crore) and others. Dinesh Gupta, Secretary of CREDAI (Western UP) said the projects stuck in NCLT needs the government\u2019s special attention. \u201cAfter a round of talks, the builders are giving consent for the scheme. These are the projects where a significant level of construction has been done and after this package, such projects will take off. However, there are a number of such stalled projects\u2026, they are either in NCLT or developer is not available or the company has gone bankrupt. Such projects need the government\u2019s special attention,\u201d said Gupta. Noida Authority CEO Lokesh M did not comment on the same. Trinamool Congress leader Shahjahan Sheikh, wanted for land grab and sexual harassment cases, was arrested by West Bengal Police from Minakhan area. He had been on the run since January 5 when his supporters attacked ED officials. The Calcutta High Court had directed that he could be arrested by CBI, ED, or state police. Protests against his aides have caused tension between TMC and BJP.

manifesto, Delhi Congress to hit the streets today", "content": "The Congress will hit the streets to gather suggestions for its manifesto for the Lok Sabha elections, the Delhi Congress announced on Wednesday. DelhiCongress president Arvinder Singh Lovely said though the INDIA bloc will have a common minimum programme at the national level, the Delhi Congress will discuss Delhi-specific issues and communicate these to its national unit for inclusion in its main manifesto. Sources said the exercise was significant given the Delhi Assembly elections next year; Lovely said party workers will go to the people to get their feedback on the problems they face, hold extensive discussions with city leaders, ex-ministers and workers before finalizing the manifesto. \u201cThe Manifesto Committee has been constituted under the chairmanship of Chaudhary Anil Kumar to study the problems of the people,\u201d Lovely said. Trinamool Congress leader Shahjahan Sheikh, wanted for land grab and sexual harassment cases, was arrested by West Bengal Police from Minakhan area. He had been on the run since January 5 when his supporters attacked ED officials. The Calcutta High Court had directed that he could be arrested by CBI, ED, or state police. Protests against his aides have caused tension between TMC and BJP.

Maharashtra, rumblings over Yavatmal-Washim candidate", "content": "Prime Minister NarendraModi\u2019s visit to Yavatmalin Maharashtra on Wednesday marked the start of the state BJP\u2019s campaign for the upcoming 2024 Lok Sabha polls. What remains unresolved though is the ruling Mahayuti\u2019s choice of candidate for the crucial Yavatmal-Washim Lok Sabha seat. Officially, the Mahayuti comprising theBJP,Shiv Sena(Eknath Shindefaction) andNationalist Congress Party(Ajit Pawar faction) is yet to announce its final list of seats and candidates. But sources say there is mounting pressure for a change in Yavatmal-Washim with a section within the BJP objecting to sitting MP Bhavana Gawali\u2019s candidature, backing minister Sanjay Rathod instead. Both Gawali and Rathod are from the Shiv Sena (Shinde faction). The speculation has not gone down well with Gawali. \u201cI am a five-term MP. I am probably the only woman MP in the state at present to have set a five-term record. Therefore, I have every right to assert my claim over the seat,\u201d Gawali told the media in Yavatmal on Wednesday. \u201cWhen Chief Minister Eknath Shinde revolted, leading to a split in the Shiv Sena in June 2022, 13 MPs joined him by switching sides. I was one of them. At that time, we were clearly told that our seats would be retained,\u201d the 50-year-old added. Dismissing talks of a likely change in candidate in Yavatmal-Washim, she said, \u201cI am going to contest. There is no question of leaving the seat\u2026why should I let go of my winning seat?Main meri Jhansi nahi doongi(I will not give up my Jhansi),\u201d she said, referring to the warrior-queen of Jhansi. In 1999, Gawali had contested from the then Washim Lok Sabha seat as a Shiv Sena (undivided) candidate. She won the seat and retained it in 2004. In 2009, following delimitation, the seat was renamed the Yavatmal-Washim seat. Gawali\u2019s successful run continued as she won the seat in 2009, 2014 and 2019 elections. \u201cThe BJP believes Sanjay Rathod has better winnability quotient. There is an anti-incumbency factor against Bhavana Gawali which may jeopardise the electoral outcome in the constituency,\u201d a highly placed source in the Mahayuti said. \u201cWhatever decision Mahayuti takes, I will accept. If they ask me to contest Lok Sabha, I will. If they field any other candidate, I will work to ensure his/her victory. I am a worker. I will strictly follow the decision taken by our leaders,\u201d Rathod said. The Yavatmal-Washim Lok Sabha constituency in Vidarbha falls in the backward region. The district has been the hotbed of the farm crisis in Maharashtra over several decades. The Kunbi and Banjara major communities play an important role in determining poll results in this constituency. While Gawali belongs to the Kunbi community, Rathod hails from the Banjara community. 2 candidates, no strangers to controversies Both Bhavana Gawali and Sanjay Rathod have courted their share of controversies. Last year, Gawali\u2019s close aide Saeed Khan was arrested on money-laundering charges and later granted bail. Khan was accused of siphoning off funds from a trust named Mahila Uttkarsh Pratishthan allegedly belonging to Gawali. Though she was questioned, the MP denied any wrongdoing in the matter. Rathod, an MLA who has been representing Digras Assembly seat for the last 20 years, was named the forest minister in the Maha Vikas Aghadi government led by Uddhav Thackeray. He landed in a controversy when then Opposition BJP attacked him over his alleged association with 20-year-old Tik Tok artist Pooja Chavan, who died inPune. The row led to Rathod\u2019s resignation from the MVA. Later, Rathod got a clean chit from the police. He was amongst the 40 Shiv Sena rebels who joined the Shinde faction and was made soil and water conservation minister. In Yavatmal-Washim, BJP ahead in Assembly segments The Yavatmal-Washim Lok Sabha seat has six Assembly segments. In 2019, the BJP won four Assembly seats \u2013 Lakhan Malik (Washim), late Rajendra Patni (Karanja), Ashok Uike (Ralegaon) and Madan Yerawar (Yavatmal). The Shiv Sena (Shinde faction) is represented by Sanjay Rathod (Digras) and NCP (Ajit Pawar faction) won one seat, Indranil Naik (Pusad). The BJP, with four Assembly segments, is likely to take a call on the candidature. PM Modi\u2019s visit to Yavatmal to address women\u2019s self-help groups and the inauguration and foundation stone laying for multiple projects worth Rs 35,000 crore is seen as a step forward in reaching out to people in the constituency. How the Yavatmal-Washim constituency has evolved From 1977 to 2004, the Washim Lok Sabha constituency was essentially a Congress bastion. It had stalwarts like former Maharashtra chief minister Vasantrao Naik (1977), Ghulam Nabi Azad (1980, 1984); Anantrao Deshmukh (1989 and 1991); and former chief minister Sudhakarrao Naik (1998). In 1996, Pundalikrao Gawali from Shiv Sena won the Lok Sabha seat. Later, his daughter Bhavana Gawali, also from the Shiv Sena, took on his mantle and won the seat from 1999 to 2004. After delimitation, the seat was called Yavatmal-Washim. In subsequent polls, from 2009 to 2019, Gawali\u2019s winning run continued. Weeks before the general elections, IE 100, the list of the 100 most powerful Indians this year, maps the lay of the land \u2014 the BJP holding strong, the Opposition trying to hold it together.

Meanwhile, theBJPand Congress have locked horns after the latter\u2019s MLA Varsha Gaikwadaccused the state government of favouring \u2018Adani, the friend of the country\u2019s Prime Minister\u2019in real estate projects in the city. She also mentioned the civic body losing its independence as administrators were allegedly facing pressure from the state government. Prime Minister NarendraModi\u2019s visit to Yavatmalin Maharashtra on Wednesday marked the start of the state BJP\u2019s campaign for the upcoming 2024 Lok Sabha polls. What remains unresolved though is the ruling Mahayuti\u2019s choice of candidate for the crucial Yavatmal-Washim Lok Sabha seat. Officially, the Mahayuti comprising theBJP,Shiv Sena(Eknath Shindefaction) andNationalist Congress Party(Ajit Pawar faction) is yet to announce its final list of seats and candidates. But sources say there is mounting pressure for a change in Yavatmal-Washim with a section within the BJP objecting to sitting MP Bhavana Gawali\u2019s candidature, backing minister Sanjay Rathod instead. Both Gawali and Rathod are from the Shiv Sena (Shinde faction). The speculation has not gone down well with Gawali. \u201cI am a five-term MP. I am probably the only woman MP in the state at present to have set a five-term record. Therefore, I have every right to assert my claim over the seat,\u201d Gawali told the media in Yavatmal on Wednesday.(Read more) Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Sanjay Raut today described the new Parliament in Delhi as a \"5-star jail,\" adding that if the INDIA coalition wins the Lok Sabha elections, they will start the Parliament session in the old building. #WATCH| Mumbai: Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Sanjay Raut says, \"The new parliament is like a five-star jail where you can't work.

This came after CCTV footage of the Hill Line police station in Thane had gone viral where BJP MLA Ganpat Gaikwad appeared to shoot at a Shinde Sena party worker leader. The footage was captured by the CCTV camera installed inside the cabin of the senior inspector of the police station. \u201cA circular has been sent to police stations across the state asking them to be careful about sharing footage captured by CCTVs in the police station. It mentions that CCTV footage is crucial from the point of view of evidence for the prosecution and it hampers their case if such footage is leaked out and goes viral,\u201d an officer said. The officer added that it showed the force in poor light when people see footage of such instances taking place in a police station.(Read more) VBA demands 27 LS seats from MVA in seat sharing, candidature to Jarange Patil from Jalna Even as the three parties in Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) comprising Congress, NCP-Sharadchandra Pawar and Shiv Sena UBT concluded their final meeting for discussion on the seat sharing allocation of Lok Sabha polls on Wednesday, the Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi put forth their proposal of contesting 27 seats out of the 48 LS seats in the state.

after Gokhale bridge opens, commuters fret over its non-alignment with Barfiwala Flyover", "content": "A day after one arm of the Gopal Krishna Gokhale bridge wasopened to traffic on February 27, providing much relief to Andheri residents, its non-alignment with the adjoining CD Barfiwala Flyover has irked commuters. The flyover is now non-accessible to commuters due to the non-alignment. The construction of the 90-metre bridge was completed within 15 months and was lauded as an \u201cenginering marvel\u201d by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). While the east-west origin and drop points of the new bridge have remained the same, the two arms of the Barfiwala Flyover and the newly built Gokhale Bridge are not aligning. As a result, motorists travelling towards Juhu will have to go via SV Road in Andheri Junction, while earlier they could take the flyover. Even as citizens alleged that the result of the non-alignment of the two bridges is a result of \u201cimproper planning\u201d, administrative agencies maintained that all relevant guidelines were followed while constructing the bridge. Speaking withThe Indian Express, the authorities maintained that the vertical alignment of the new bridge was increased as per the guidelines prescribed by the Indian Railways. Vertical alignment refers to the axis of an elevated bridge between its foundation base and girders. \u201cSince the Union ministry us upgrading railway lines across the country, their latest set of guidelines say that any new railway overbridge (ROB) should be constructed at an additional height of two metres. The Barfiwala Flyover was constructed earlier, therefore, there is a height mismatch and I assure that the two bridges will be merged by year-end and no demolition work will be carried out for this,\u201d Chahal had said during his inaugural speech. Western Railway spokesperson Sumit Thakur told The Indian Express that the Barfiwala Flyover did not exist in the blueprint of the new Gokhale bridge that was shown to the railways for alignment. \u201cThe Barfiwala Flyover originates from the western side of Andheri and it doesn\u2019t go above the railway tracks. Therefore, giving any recommendation pertaining to this bridge doesn\u2019t concern our office. Our office was involved with the construction and demolition of the new Gokhale Bridge only,\u201d Thakur told Express. \u201cHowever, the BMC was told to increase the height of the new Gokhale Bridge by two metres as the policy of the Indian Railways mandated. The vertical alignments of ROBs are increased as a safety mechanism since high-speed trains run on these tracks and the older bridge was constructed in the 1960s. Therefore, to meet the modern day requirements, it was advised to increase the alignment,\u201d he said. P Velrasu, additional municipal commissioner (Projects) who spearheaded the construction project of the new Gokhale Bridge, said that it was the BMC\u2019s plan to merge the two bridges. \u201cSince the Railways had mandated us to increase the vertical alignment, we had to adhere by it. Therefore, the only way to merge the two bridges was by creating a new ramp. However, considering the space we had, the ramp would become very steep that in turn would be dangerous for motorists,\u201d Velrasu said. Nitin Killawala, an architect and Juhu resident, said that the issue must have been properly negotiated by the authorities. \u201cThe absence of Barfiwala Flyover is creating a huge traffic congestion in Juhu area. The authorities should have chalked out an alternative plan to merge the two bridges,\u201d said Killawala. Nitin Desai, another resident from Andheri east, said, \u201cInstead of opening this bridge haphazardly, the authorities should have waited for a while and opened all six lanes together.\u201d Velrasu said that the BMC has appointed the IIT-B and Veermata Jijabai Technical Institute (VJTI) for creating an alternative to realign these two bridges. \u201cOur first priority was to open the Gokhale Bridge as early as possible since it is a primary connector\u2026 Now that one arm of this bridge is ready, a decision on realigning it with the Barfiwala flyover will be taken up after the experts submit their report,\u201d Velrasu told Express. He said that there are two ways of aligning the bridge \u2014 one by creating a connector and second to demolish the existing Barfiwala flyover and construct a new one. A technical committee of experts from these two institutes will submit a report, following which the civic body will take a call. A key east-west connector in the western suburbs, the Gokhale bridge connects the eastern and western parts of Andheri \u2013 an important commercial and residential hub in suburbanMumbai. According to the railway officials, the alignment of this bridge was prepared during the 1960s and the bridge had existed since then. In July 2018, a portion of this bridge collapsed, leading to five deaths, following which a structural audit was carried out. In November 2022, the civic authorities closed the bridge and announced that a new bridge will be constructed after demolishing the old structure. The work order for constructing this new bridge was issued in January 2023 and on Monday, the BMC opened the new bridge partially for vehicular movement. Weeks before the general elections, IE 100, the list of the 100 most powerful Indians this year, maps the lay of the land \u2014 the BJP holding strong, the Opposition trying to hold it together.

"Maharashtra struggles with high sickle cell anemia cases over insufficient health infra", "content": "Maharashtra, India\u2019s wealthiest state, grapples with the challenge of being the third-highest in sickle cell anemia (SCA) cases, predominantly affecting the tribal population. Despite efforts to eliminate the disease by 2047, the state contends with insufficient health infrastructure. Across 26 districts where the blood disorder prevails, patients find themselves in dire need of treatment, facing the risk of deformities as well as it being a threat to their lives. On Rare Disease Day,The Indian Expressspoke with patients and doctors, stressing the need for enhanced health infrastructure to accomplish the National Sickle Cell Anemia Elimination Mission by 2047. Manoj Ramkrishna Ramtake (31) from Gadchiroli living with the blood disorder, has developed hip joint osteonecrosis as a result of reduced blood flow and it has led to bone tissue damage and deterioration. His condition is so severe he is unable to walk and has to be carri. In the absence of an experienced orthopedic surgeon, he has been referred to Nagpur AIIMS for knee replacement surgery. \u201cMy family has already spent over Rs 1 lakh on my treatment in private hospitals. Since I have been suffering from the disease since adolescence. I had to drop out of school due to the pain,\u201d Manoj said. This is not an isolated case. Patients with SCA facing organ failure and bone necrosis are consistently referred to distant, larger cities, reflecting the inadequate health infrastructure in rural areas. Patients and doctors have said this disparity persists in regions with the highest prevalence of the disorder. Dr Ramesh Katre, a senior doctor from Gadchiroli, instrumental in incorporating a chapter on sickle cell anemia in all higher educational institutions in India, emphasises that over 40 per cent of cases experience associated complications. Interruptions in treatment due to insufficient awareness and the availability of medicine contribute significantly to the challenges of SCA management. SCA is a genetic blood disorder prevalent in India, resulting in abnormal hemoglobin, deformed red blood cells, pain, and complications. Being a rare disease, India has the second-highest incidence globally after Africa. Surgical complications are elevated in SCD patients, presenting risks of acute chest syndrome, infections, and severe pain. Rural doctors lack training for such challenges. \u201cWe lack haematologists for overseeing vital blood transfusions to enhance oxygen delivery, and there are no facilities for knee or hip replacement post bone necrosis from sickle cell anaemia,\u201d Katre said.  Commenting on it, Dr Daval Salve, district health officer (DHO) refuted the need for haematologists in treating such patients. \u201cYes, we don\u2019t have haematologists in government hospitals but the general doctors and surgeons are qualified enough to handle such cases,\u201d he says. This is despite the fact that Gadchiroli has the highest caseload with 4,168, as per information obtained through a Right to Information (RTI) application filed by The Indian Express. It is followed by Nagpur (2,617), Amravati (1861), Gondia (1398) and Yavatmal (950). SCA inflicts damage on kidneys by creating blockages in blood vessels, resulting in reduced blood flow\u2014the most prevalent side effect of this blood disorder. Unfortunately, in rural regions where nephrologists are scarce, patients face significant challenges. Take, for instance, the case of 31-year-old Naresh Donode from Gondia, a district with a tribal population of 16.18 per cent as per the 2011 census. Diagnosed with SCA in adolescence, he dedicated his life to the well-being of fellow patients. However, in 2022, he noticed swelling on his legs and face. Seeking medical help at the district hospital revealed the absence of specialists, leading to a referral to AIIMS, Nagpur. After undergoing tests there, he received the devastating diagnosis of kidney failure. He has spend over Rs 2 lakh till date on diagnosis and medical care. Expressing his predicament, he said, \u201cI have visited AIIMS Nagpur eight times for diagnosis and treatment, selling off my wife\u2019s gold. Now, I have been asked to undergo dialysis, but with SCA, undergoing it in a government setup is challenging in the absence of a haematologist to monitor, given the vascular access challenges and higher infection risks.\u201d After an inquiry with the district civic surgeon Dr Mohabe, it was highlighted that severe cases necessitate referrals to higher tertiary care due to the absence of specialists in the region. At present, the state contributes nearly 15 per cent to the national caseload. The Sickle Cell Anaemia Elimination program, initiated after its announcement in last year\u2019s budget, reports a total of 102,021 cases in India. Maharashtra ranks third with 15,163 cases, following Odisha (49,095) andChhattisgarh(18,207). Of the total cases in Maharashtra, 8,842 are female and 6,318 are male. Additionally, 90,000 individuals are asymptomatic carriers of the condition. The state has screened over 32 lakh people in 26 districts and is set to initiate prenatal genetic testing. Typically performed between 15 and 20 weeks of pregnancy, amniocentesis collects amniotic fluid to analyse foetal cells for the presence of the sickle cell gene. \u201cWe have tied up with the Borivali bone marrow transplant centre (run by BMC) for the testing. Pregnant women with the disorder are taken to the centre free of cost for the test,\u201d he said. Gautam Dongre, Secretary of the National Alliance of Sickle Cell Organizations (NASCO) and a Member of the Sickle Cell Council in the Government of India questioned the initiative. He expressed concerns about the practicality. He stated that it would require pregnant women to travel hundreds of kilometres to reachMumbai, a journey most tribal women would likely refuse. \u201cThe Centre plans to eliminate the disease, ensuring no child is born with it. For this, they need to conduct genetic testing when a woman is pregnant in close proximity in areas with the most cases. However, significant centres like AIIMS in Nagpur lack the necessary facilities,\u201d he said. A patient with SCA requires a daily intake of 5mg of folic acid twice a day and one tablet of Hydroxyurea. Unfortunately, these essential medications are frequently unavailable, causing significant challenges for patients. Dr Katre said, \u201cOften, these medicines are not on the shelves. It becomes troublesome for patients to sacrifice their daily wages and stand in queues repeatedly to obtain the medications. As a result, they discontinue the treatment until their condition deteriorates.\u201d An issue outlined by a patient rights organisation is the unavailability of blood, which is life-saving for patients suffering from the disorder. Although the National Health Mission promises free blood transfusions for all sickle cell patients, the patients claim the ground reality is different. \u201cSuch patients require blood transfusion in an emergency. But in the absence of blood banks in rural areas, the patient\u2019s relatives are being forced to find replacement blood, which is just a waste in the golden hour of treatment,\u201d said Dongre. Dr Mohabe highlighted that severe cases necessitate referrals to higher tertiary care due to the absence of specialists in the region. He said, \u201cOur sole nephrologist (in the district) who assisted in dialysis for sickle cell patients, has resigned. With no nephrologist, we\u2019re actively seeking a contractual doctor from Nagpur to fill this crucial role.\u201d \u201cThe Centre plans to eliminate the disease, ensuring no child is born with it. For this, they need to conduct genetic testing when a woman is pregnant in close proximity to areas with the most cases. However, significant centres like AIIMS in Nagpur lack the necessary facilities,\u201d he said. Echoing the same, Dr Mohabe said, \u201cWe have yet to initiate prenatal testing due to challenges in transporting pregnant mothers from Gondia to Borivali. We\u2019ve requested the health department to establish this facility at AIIMS Nagpur.\u201d Trinamool Congress leader Shahjahan Sheikh, wanted for land grab and sexual harassment cases, was arrested by West Bengal Police from Minakhan area. He had been on the run since January 5 when his supporters attacked ED officials. The Calcutta High Court had directed that he could be arrested by CBI, ED, or state police. Protests against his aides have caused tension between TMC and BJP.

"headline": "TMC\u2019s Sandeshkhali strongman Shahjahan Sheikh arrested, sent to 10-day police custody", "content": "Absconding Trinamool Congress leader and the party\u2019s strongman in SandeshkhaliShahjahan Sheikh,who had been on the run since the last 55 days, was arrested by the West Bengal Police early Thursday. He was sent to police custody for 10 days by a local court. Sheikh and his aides are among the key accused in cases of land grab and sexual harassment that surfaced following violent protests in Sandeshkhali island of North 24 Parganas district. He had been absconding since January 5 after a team of ED officials was attacked by a mob of his supporters near his residence in Sandeshkhali. Although the police had sought a full term, the court only granted 10 days. According to the police, \u201cOn February 7, 8 and 9, some isolated incidents took place in Sandeshkhali. Sheikh Shahjahan is the main accused in the incident related to the attack on ED officials. Then, in February, complaints were filed against him in several other cases. In the cases filed after February 8, Sheikh Shahjahan has been named as an accused and each of them are based on incidents that happened 2-3 years ago.\u201d \u201cThe West Bengal Police arrested Sheikh Shahjahan this morning,\u201d police officials toldThe Indian Express. According to the police, Shahjahan was picked up from the North 24 Parganas district post-midnight. Following this arrest, he was taken to Basirhat court and was kept in the court\u2019s lock-up. The police said that a team had been monitoring the TMC leader\u2019s activities for several days leading up to the arrest. Explaining about the arrest, the police claimed that they had to go past legal obstacles. \u201cThere was a legal obligation to arrest Shahjahan Sheikh. However, the arrest came only after the court lifted the stay order,\u201d ADG (South Bengal) Supratim Sarkar said. He added: \u201cSheikh was arrested from the Minakhan police station area under several Sections of the Indian Penal Code, including 147 (rioting) and 148 (whoever is guilty of rioting, being armed with a deadly weapon or with anything which, used as a weapon of).\u201d Addressing reporters, the senior police official requested leaders of Opposition parties to avoid creating divisions in the Sandeshkhali area. \u201cSome leaders, especially from the Opposition party, are making accusations against the police, which is very painful for us. It is better not to do such things,\u201d he added. Sarkar also questioned the ED\u2019s role in the case. \u201cWhy did the ED not arrest him? We do not want to disclose this matter for the sake of investigation. I will tell the court what to say,\u201d he added. #WATCH| West Bengal | TMC leader Sheikh Shahjahan being brought out of Basirhat Court by the State Police. He has been remanded to 10-day Police custody.pic.twitter.com/fSQxi6dxLM \u2014 ANI (@ANI)February 29, 2024 Reacting to the news, TMC\u2019s National General Secretary Saket Gokhale wrote on social media platform X: \u201cAs our Natl Gen Sec @abhishekaitc had rightly pointed out \u2014 it was a Calcutta HC stay order that had restrained the police. We had also committed that Sheikh Shahjahan would be arrested WITHIN DAYS if the Hon\u2019ble HC freed the hands of the police. On 26th Feb, the HC clarified that WB Police can arrest Sheikh Shahjahan. And today, in less than 72 hours, he has been arrested by West Bengal Police.\u201d He added, \u201cNow remember \u2014 despite multiple protests across the nation, the Modi Govt NEVER arrested Brij Bhushan Sharan. In fact, he even continues to be a Lok Sabha MP of theBJPdespite all his crimes. Thats the difference betweenMamata Banerjee& the criminal-protecting byNarendra Modi.\u201d West Bengal Police has arrested Sandeshkhali accused Sheikh Shahjahan this morning. As our Natl Gen Sec@abhishekaitchad rightly pointed out \u2013 it was a Calcutta HC stay order that had restrained the police. We had also committed that Sheikh Shahjahan would be arrested WITHIN\u2026 \u2014 Saket Gokhale (@SaketGokhale)February 29, 2024 Meanwhile, TMC spokesperson Kunal Ghosh demanded the arrest of BJP leader Suvendhu Adhikari. \u201cThe state police have acted. Now, let CBI arrest Shuvendu Adhikari and Alchemist Chit Fund brand ambassadorMithun Chakrabortyin the Narada case. Let Brij Bhushan, the hero of barbarism, be arrested. Let the ED catch the country\u2019s robbers. The court had obstructed, the police could not work. Now, the police have done their job,\u201d the TMC spokesperson said. TMC MP Santanu Sen, too, lauded the state government over the action. \u201cHis arrest proves that our government follows \u2018rajdharma\u2019 in an administrative manner. We had taken action against Partha Chatterjee and Jyotipriya Mallick, and similarly, we have taken action against Shibu Hazra and Uttam Sardar. And now, Sheikh Shahjahan, too, has been arrested.\u201d He added: \u201cAbhishek Banerjee had said that the police were unable to arrest him due to the court\u2019s stay order. He has been arrested within 3-4 days of the removal of the stay order. On one side, leaders accused of crimes roam around freely in BJP-ruled states and on the other side, our administration doesn\u2019t spare even if they are from the ruling party. BJP should learn \u2018rajdharma\u2019 from the TMC.\u201d The BJP, meanwhile, linked the arrest to the saffron party\u2019s continuous agitation over the matter. West Bengal BJP state president Sukanta Majumdar said, \u201cDue to the continuous agitation by the BJP, this government was compelled to arrest Sheikh Shahjahan. The government was in a mode of denial. They were not even accepting that anything has happened. I had already said that we would compel the government to arrest Sheikh Shahjahan. Today, due to the agitation of the BJP and the women of Sandeshkhali, the government and Mamata Banerjee were compelled to arrest him.\u201d The Calcutta High Court, on Monday, had clarified that there is no stay on Sheikh\u2019s arrest and it had only stayed a single judge\u2019s order on February 7 to constitute a Special Investigation Team to probe allegations that ED officers were attacked while trying to conduct raids at Sheikh\u2019s residence (on January 5). During the hearing, the bench also pulled up the state government for failing to arrest Sheikh for more than 50 days. Weeks before the general elections, IE 100, the list of the 100 most powerful Indians this year, maps the lay of the land \u2014 the BJP holding strong, the Opposition trying to hold it together.

Kaliaganj MLA joins BJP; former Congress leader believed to be next", "content": "In a boost for the Bengal unit of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ahead of the Lok Sabha elections, Kaliaganj MLA Soumen Roy, who had defected to the ruling TMC, returned to the saffron camp on Wednesday. At the same time, speculations were rife that Koustav Bagchi \u2014 who quit the Congress on Wednesday \u2013 would be joining the BJP. Roy had switched parties after the 2021 Assembly polls. He joined theBJPat its office inKolkatain the presence of Leader of Opposition in West Bengal Assembly Suvendu Adhikari. Speaking to mediapersons, Roy said that he had joined the TMC even after winning on a BJP ticket \u201cunder pressure from the ruling dispensation and local administration\u201d. \u201cHowever, psychologically, I was always with the BJP. The ruling party leadership was not allowing me to work for the people in my constituency, who had elected me. Therefore, I decided to return to the BJP,\u201d said Roy. Adhikari credited BJPRajya SabhaMP Ananta Maharaj for convincing Roy to make a comeback. Sources said Roy had been in touch with Adhikari for the past three months. The TMC accused Roy of joining the BJP \u201cin exchange for money\u201d. \u201cHe had joined the TMC despite winning the election on a BJP ticket because he felt that it was an anti-Bengali party. Now, he has returned to the party which is not only anti-Bengali but anti-Bengal as its government at the Centre has imposed an economic embargo on the state. Therefore, we feel that he has joined the saffron camp in exchange of money,\u201d said party\u2019s state vice-president Jay Prakash Majumdar. Meanwhile, West Bengal Congress leader Koustav Bagchi resigned from the party on Wednesday, accusing the party high command of seeing \u201cthe Trinamool Congress as its West Bengal unit\u201d and being \u201cmore interested in forging a friendship with the TMC than strengthening the state party unit\u201d. Speculations are rife that Bagchi is likely to join the BJP ahead of the upcoming Lok Sabha polls. Bagchi, an advocate, came into the limelight last year after he was arrested by the police for his remarks against West Bengal Chief MinisterMamata Banerjee. He later shaved his head and said he would remain bald till the TMC government was in power in the state. \u201cHe needed an excuse to leave the party. He is maligning the image of the party so that he can jump the ship and join another party. He was also skipping party meetings,\u201d Congress leader Soumya Aich Roy said. Rajya Sabha MP-elect and BJP spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya said the Congress is losing ground across the country, including West Bengal. Santhan, a Sri Lankan citizen and one of the convicts in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case, passed away at 55 in Chennai. He spent 32 years in prison, 10 in solitary confinement, and 22 on death row. Despite being released in 2022, he was sent to a foreign prisoner camp.

Express", "headline": "Mamata slams BJP on Sandeshkhali: Don\u2019t equate with Nandigram, Singur", "content": "Days after Leader of Opposition in Assembly Suvendu Adhikari compared the situation in unrest-hit Sandeshkhali to the Nandigram agitation, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee Wednesday said the protests in Singur and Nandigram can\u2019t be compared to the ones in the island in North 24 Parganas. Speaking during a programme in Bankura district, she alleged that those comparing the protests were trying to \u201cstoke violence\u201d in the state. Without taking any names, the CM said, \u201cRemember Singur, Nandigram, Khatra, and Bishnupur \u2014 there are different faces everywhere. They are trying to spark violence everywhere by comparing one to another. I don\u2019t want bloodshed or torture anywhere. Those who are making tall claims, I ask them, should I open your bhandar (account)? I have a lot of things there. I never support any wrong knowingly. If unknowingly something has happened, I don\u2019t support that and help people every way.\u201d On Saturday, LoP in state Assembly and Nandigram MLA Suvendu Adhikari had said, \u201cThe situation in Sandeshkhali is like Nandigram. In Nandigram, people fought against land acquisition and here people are fighting against land grab. Here, protests began after women started their movement against sexual harassment but land grabbing is the second most common allegation in Sandeshkhali.\u201d In 2007-08, a movement against \u201cforcible\u201d land acquisition in Nandigram in Purba Medinipur district by the then Left Front government had catapulted the TMC to power in 2011. Sandeshkhali has been tense after local residents went on rampage against TMC leaders Shahjahan Sheikh and his aides while accusing them of land grab and sexually harassing women. The CM alleged that under her government, adivasis (tribals) in Birbhum district were living in peace, whereas inBJP-ruled states the atrocities against these communities were rising. \u201cIn BJP-ruled states, tribals are tortured and oppressed. We have made laws that ensure that adivasi lands are not captured because the jungle is their right. We have told the Centre that many tribals perform \u2018prakriti puja\u2019 (worship nature) and have asked for Sari and Sarna faiths to be recognised as religions. If they don\u2019t deliver on this, we will organise a mass movement in the coming days to demand the recognition of Sari and Sarna faith.\u201d The Trinamool Congress (TMC) chief criticised the Centre over the\u00a0 Uniform Civil Code issue and the ongoing farm protests. The state Assembly in BJP-ruled Uttarakhand recently passed the Uniform Civil Code (UCC), Uttarakhand, Bill 2024. The proposed law seeks to\u00a0 \u201cgovern and regulate the laws related to marriage and divorce, successions, live-in relationships, and matters related thereto\u201d. \u201cThere are various communities and they have their rituals \u2013 be it adivasis, Hindus, Muslims, or Tapasilis. But they want to break all existing rules and bring a Uniform Civil Code law \u2013 one rule for all. They don\u2019t want people to eat meat and eggs. They are deciding on what uniform girls will wear to school. Farmers are being oppressed and being implicated by the National Investigation Agency. Those who killed farmers with bullets are now talking about farmers,\u201d she added. Reacting sharply to the incident where a Sikh IPS officer was called \u2018Khalistiani\u2019 during a BJP protest near Sandeshkhali, Banerjee said, \u201cThey look at Sikhs and call them Khalistanis. Does anyone wearing a turban become a Khalistani? If someone has a Muslim name, they are branded as Pakistanis. They should be questioned on their work first!\u201d The CM slammed the BJP-led Centre for blocking state funds under various welfare schemes. \u201cThe Central government has stopped all our funds. They collect money from Bengal but do not give us our rightful share. Let\u2019s unite against those who have deprived, maligned, and tortured Bengal, and ensure that there is \u2018gorjon\u2019 (roar) in Bengal. What others can\u2019t, Bengal can.\u201d Santhan, a Sri Lankan citizen and one of the convicts in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case, passed away at 55 in Chennai. He spent 32 years in prison, 10 in solitary confinement, and 22 on death row. Despite being released in 2022, he was sent to a foreign prisoner camp.

from Delhi that posed as cops, robbed Yemeni nationals seeking medical treatment", "content": "The Pune police have busted a criminal gang from Delhi and arrested four suspects, achieving a major breakthrough in back-to-back cases in which Yemeni nationals who had come to Pune for medical treatment were robbed by those who impersonated police. Officials said that as part of the probe, the investigation team scrutinised footage from over 600 CCTV cameras installed on the road fromPuneto Daman, where the suspects stayed at a beach resort. According to the police, the latest incident took place at Ashirwad Chowk in Kondhwa on the afternoon of February 8, when a 52-year-old Yemeni national was targeted. Around 4.30 pm on February 8, a car approached him from behind when he was passing from Ashirwad Chowk. A man got out of the car, identified himself as a police officer, and started talking to the Yemeni national in Arabic. On the pretext of checking his documents and what he carried, the suspect allegedly took the victim\u2019s identity, documents, and foreign and Indian currency. The suspect started sniffing these objects with their nose, saying he was checking them. All of a sudden, he got into the car and fled from the scene before the victim could react. The suspect allegedly decamped with Saudi riyal, US dollars, and Indian rupees, totalling a total equivalent value of Rs 4.79 lakh. In September last year, a 47-year-old Yemen national was identically cheated of $4,000. A team from the Kondhwa police station was probing various leads available in these cases. The team zeroed in on a car used in the February 8 case. It traced the trail of this car by carefully examining footage from over 600 CCTV cameras. The probe led police to a beach resort in Daman, where the suspects stayed after they fled Pune on February 8. Over the last five days, the police arrested four suspects fromDelhiand their involvement in both cases has come to light. The arrested suspects have been identified as Sikandar Ali Khan, 46; Kareem Feroz Khan, 29; Irfan Hussain Hashmi, 44; and Mehboob Abdul Khan, 59; all residents of Jangpura in South Delhi. The police recovered from them the foreign currency robbed in both cases. The investigation team is also probing whether the same set of suspects were involved in two more identical cases: one from September last year in which a 32-year-old Yemeni national was cheated of $1,100 in Pune Camp and a 58-year-old Yemen national of $4,000 in Kondhwa in April last year. \u201cMany Yemen nationals and citizens from other West Asian countries who come to Pune for medical treatment, stay in the Kondhwa area along with their families. Many of them stay here for longer periods during their treatments. We have reasons to believe that suspects were receiving specific information on when to target the victims, as in when they would be carrying large amounts of cash with them. At this stage, we are probing the source of the information they were receiving.\u201d said an officer part of the probe. Trinamool Congress leader Shahjahan Sheikh, wanted for land grab and sexual harassment cases, was arrested by West Bengal Police from Minakhan area. He had been on the run since January 5 when his supporters attacked ED officials. The Calcutta High Court had directed that he could be arrested by CBI, ED, or state police. Protests against his aides have caused tension between TMC and BJP.

Express", "headline": "Appointment of Marathi-medium teachers in Urdu-medium schools meets with opposition in Maharashtra", "content": "Urdu-medium teachers\u2019 associations have raised concerns over the appointment of Marathi medium teachers as English teachers in Urdu medium schools in the first phase of Maharashtra\u2019s ongoing teacher recruitment process. Over 11,000 teaching posts in zilla parishad, municipal corporation, municipality and government-aided schools all over Maharashtra have been filled in the first phase of recruitment. At least 160 posts for English teachers in Urdu-medium schools have been filled by Marathi medium candidates. There are over 5,000 Urdu-medium schools in the state and over 100 inPunecity, of which 35 are run by the Pune Municipal Corporation. State president of All India Urdu Teachers Association Ilhajodin Farooqi said, \u201cIf the students are Urdu-speaking, then teachers from the Urdu medium who know both English and Urdu will be best. The same thing can have different words in Urdu and in Marathi. If we want good-quality English education, teachers should be able to first explain to children the concepts and rules of English in Urdu, which they understand best. How will a teacher who speaks English and Marathi do that?\u201d Representatives of the Shikshak Sabha met with Deepak Kesarkar and handed him a memorandum of their demands. They are citing Clause 7 of a circular that was put out by the Education Department on 18 September, 2023 which said that only candidates who have received education in a certain medium in class 10th can be recruited to teach in a school of that medium. Farooqui said that the appointment list in violation of this circular put up on Pavitra Portal. Responding to these concerns, commissioner of education Suraj Mandhare issued a press note stating, \u201cIn the entire school, if there is just one teacher from a different medium, it is only helpful as students will get more exposure.\u201d An education official said, \u201cWe have appointed teachers for English-teaching positions on the basis of the candidate\u2019s knowledge of English and degree qualifications. Candidates will choose a different medium school only if they are ready to teach there so it should not be an issue.\u201d Trinamool Congress leader Shahjahan Sheikh, wanted for land grab and sexual harassment cases, was arrested by West Bengal Police from Minakhan area. He had been on the run since January 5 when his supporters attacked ED officials. The Calcutta High Court had directed that he could be arrested by CBI, ED, or state police. Protests against his aides have caused tension between TMC and BJP.

Parli, a lady sweeping the temple found a baby kept in a basket. She immediately alerted Vinayak Khiste, who looked after the temple. Khiste recalls the day, \u201cWe found her at 7am. When I first saw her, she looked like a healthy baby. When she started crying, I said to her, \u201cDon\u2019t cry little baby, life is for being happy\u201d, and she chuckled. Today, she has come back and she is crying again.\u201d Talking to the media, the girl, Neha, said, \u201cI am feeling very emotional looking at the place where I was left behind. I will be very happy if I can get to meet my biological parents once. I have come back with the hope of meeting them.\u201d Khiste followed due procedure and took the baby to the nearest police station. Lawyer Anjali Pawar, who is helping Neha find her parents, said, \u201cWe traced back as much as we could. TheFIRwas registered back then by ASI Puri. After that she was admitted to Pandharpur Navrange Balakashram. In a few days, she was sent toPune\u2019s Preet Mandir institution from where she was adopted in 2003.\u201d Khiste said a medical report confirmed that she was 30 days old at the time and it was submitted to the police.Pawar has been working on this since 2020. She said, \u201cChildren who get adopted abroad usually know from early on that they are adopted. They have the curiosity to know Indian culture and know from where they have come. She couldn\u2019t come here during Covid, but now she is finally here.\u201d Weeks before the general elections, IE 100, the list of the 100 most powerful Indians this year, maps the lay of the land \u2014 the BJP holding strong, the Opposition trying to hold it together.

{"source": "Indian Express", "headline": "Free cutting-edge genetic testing for kids with rare disorders at this govt-run Mumbai lab", "content": "The Indian Council of Medical Research\u2019s National Institute of Reproductive and Child Health (ICMR-NIRRCH) Genetic Research Centre (GRC) in Mumbai has become the first government centre in Maharashtra to offer free and state-of-the-art genetic testing and counselling services for rare diseases. The centre is currently offering its services to referrals from prominent municipal corporations, government medical colleges, and hospitals in the surrounding areas ofMumbai, as well as catering to rural populations from across Maharashtra, as well as other parts of India. With its cutting-edge genetic diagnostic laboratory and official Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques Act, 1994 (PCPNDT) approval, the centre is fully equipped to conduct genetic counselling and testing, ensuring comprehensive support for individuals affected by these serious diseases. Rare diseases (RDs) are typically chronic and progressive medical conditions that pose life-threatening risks to those affected. It is important to note that out of the 350 million patients suffering from rare diseases globally, India alone is home to approximately 72-96 million patients, according to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW). According to experts, children are often most affected, with a considerable number of rare disorders having a genetic basis and manifesting in childhood. About 35% of deaths resulting from genetic disorders among children occur within the first year of life, while 10% transpire between ages one and five, and 12% between ages five and 15. The diagnosis of rare diseases is also challenging, and there is no approved treatment for 95% of rare diseases. This underscores the potential advantages of early genetic testing. The ICMR-NIRRCH\u2019s Genetic Research Centre aims to address this problem by enhancing access to high-quality and free-of-cost testing and counselling services. . Currently, the centre is providing its services to around 570 families yearly, covering genetic conditions during infancy, childhood, and adolescence, as well as reproductive difficulties faced by couples. Additionally, as one of the sites in the Mission Program for Paediatric Rare Diseases, the centre assesses clinically abnormal cases of rare paediatric diseases. Speaking about the research centre, Dr. Geetanjali Sachdeva, director of ICMR-NIRRCH said, \u201cStrengthening access to genetic testing and counselling for rare diseases will pave the way for their early diagnosis and timely intervention, helping improve the health and wellbeing of some of the most vulnerable sections of society. This is a revolutionary step that can transform several lives, especially young lives in the country.\u201d Dr. Shailesh Pande, medical geneticist and head of the Genetic Research Centre, said, \u201cOur centre is working to address a critical public health concern. By reaching out to special schools, hospitals and the public, we are striving to raise awareness around rare diseases and enhance uptake of essential testing and counselling. In doing so, we aim to mitigate the societal burden of these diseases and realize the national goal of a healthy society, with universal access to healthcare services.\u201d Trinamool Congress leader Shahjahan Sheikh, wanted for land grab and sexual harassment cases, was arrested by West Bengal Police from Minakhan area. He had been on the run since January 5 when his supporters attacked ED officials. The Calcutta High Court had directed that he could be arrested by CBI, ED, or state police. Protests against his aides have caused tension between TMC and BJP.

Express", "headline": "New Chandigarh Sectt: Take a tour of Rs 80-crore plush building", "content": "A whopping Rs 80 crore has been spent on the new Chandigarh Secretariat, a building where every corner oozes opulence. Located a few metres from the previous one, the plush building in Sector 9 was inaugurated early last year. On Tuesday, the Punjab and Haryana High Court asked the UT to file an affidavit as to how much money has been spent on the new secretariat building and how much area is lying vacant in the old secretariat. The HC also asked about the footfall in this building. The expenditure on theChandigarhSecretariat that houses the offices of top brass of the Chandigarh Administration has always been a matter of debate, with residents questioning the building\u2019s utility at the cost of taxpayers\u2019 money and asking whether it would make the \u201cofficers more accessible\u201d. When one enters the building, the wide luxurious lobby with huge chandeliers can easily compete with that of a five-star hotel. The entire first floor is dedicated only to the office of UT Adviser and Governor with scores of rest rooms, waiting rooms for their guests and conference halls. The entire second floor is dedicated to Home Secretary\u2019s office, Secretary (culture) and their branches. The entire third floor has Finance Secretary\u2019s office , Secretary (tourism) and his branches while the fourth floor has the Health Secretary\u2019s office and his branches concerned. Other secretaries sit in other offices on the other floors . This building is primarily being used only by the top brass of UT while the other staff sits in the old building, even after one year of it being functional. However, staff of two key departments \u2014 engineering staff with chief engineer\u2019s office and architect department \u2014 sit in the old building which is two buildings away, even after over a year of inauguration. The Indian Expresshad last year reported how the then adviser\u2019s personal office boasts a rooftop rest area that rivals even the most luxurious of farmhouses. It has decorative umbrellas, modern furniture and an abundance of flowers. Real grass had been grown on the floor on the rooftop. The area was primarily used by the then Adviser for his special guests. Also, there is a dynamic lighting system which goes off automatically when no one is in the room. From plush chandeliers to Chandigarh architecture-based paintings, the building screams luxury. Even the waiting rooms have Pierre Jeanerette-inspired sofas and wooden partition dividers for privacy. An entire wall is dedicated to Le Corbusier and other iconic features of the city such as Rock Garden, Open Hand and Capitol Complex. A senior officer of the administration stated that \u201cthis building has a 5 star green rating (as per GRIHA NORMS of GOI) and it\u2019s a zero-waste building with STP (sewage treatment plant) on site where waste water is treated onsite\u201d. The officer stated that this building which is state-of-the-art building \u201cis an energy-efficient building and almost 50% of energy needs are met through solar panels\u201d. \u201cThe second building of this kind is a new building of Chandigarh after the Chandigarh Housing Board,\u201d the official said. This building that has a ground floor plus six floors has been constructed over a period of 34 months, with features incorporated into the design to reduce its carbon footprint. The new building hardly sees much footfall. The first floor occupied by the office of the UT Adviser has plush waiting rooms, committee rooms, a separate VC (video conferencing) room and rest rooms. Each floor is made disabled-friendly with tactile paving. Tactile paving has been done in a way that straight lines show a path and dots denote a junction, turn or function like a toilet, staircase etc. Spread over 2.63 acres and situated between Chandigarh Housing Board building and police headquarters, the new secretariat building in Sector 9 is said to be the city\u2019s first five-star-rated green building with a minimum carbon footprint with a total covered area of 2,14,818 square feet. Officers added that the reason for the whopping expenditure is that it is a smart and intelligent building. \u201cChandigarh Secretariat building is a green smart and intelligent building that not just conforms to 5 star Griha rating system, it has an insulated roof, terrace garden, solar reflective tiles on terrace to curtail the heat transfer, drip irrigation for water conservation etc,\u201d the official said. Weeks before the general elections, IE 100, the list of the 100 most powerful Indians this year, maps the lay of the land \u2014 the BJP holding strong, the Opposition trying to hold it together.

govt\u2019s helpline number for help", "content": "In the on-going exam season, the Punjab government\u2019s initiative to start a telephonic helpline \u201cKaro Har Parikheya Fateh\u201d, to counsel students appearing in class 10 and 12 board exams, seems to have paid off. From students asking for sample papers to those who never had a subject teacher at their school for whole year, or the ones who simply feel blank while writing their papers\u2014the anxious students preparing for the boards are expressing their hearts out to seek guidance from the trained counsellors, who are operating from a control room inLudhiana. Taking their every query in a positive way, counsellors are even answering their innocent queries, to make them feel relaxed and heard. Even parents are calling for help. The anxiety level is such that many call with a hesitant and shivering voice, only finding the courage to speak up after being motivated by the counselor on the other end. Once relaxed, they open up. A class-12 student from Ludhiana confided in the counsellor that their government school never had an economics teacher for the whole year. \u201cThere was no economics teacher in our school for whole year. We are trying our best now but we need help in numericals. Even one mark questions are difficult to attempt as we haven\u2019t studied all chapters in detail,\u201d said the girl. An anxious mother asked: \u201cMy son is giving class-10 exams. But he stops eating due to stress. What should I do?\u201d The mother even asks: \u201cCan you also provide sample papers\u201d, to which the counsellor replies that the helpline is only for stress busting and confidence boosting sessions for the child, not to provide sample papers. Physics and mathematics continue to scare the students the most. A student appearing for class-12 physics paper asked: \u201cSir, I am in tension. Can you please tell me important questions from the chapter \u201cOptics\u201d. I feel I will fail,\u201d said another caller. Among the most common queries being received on the helpline are from the students who feel they forget everything while writing the answers and simply go blank despite full preparation. \u201cSir mujhe bahut darr lag raha hai paper ka, kuch bhi yaad karo nahi ho raha hai.I forget everything when I reach the exam centre. I go blank. I am unable to memorize,\u201d expressed another caller. \u201cMainu paper di bahut tension hoyi payi hai..I have prepared but I don\u2019t have confidence. I feel the answer that my friend wrote is right, I wrote wrong,\u201d said another student over the call. Many such other callers had queries such as: \u201cWill I pass? What if I fail? Even my Punjabi paper did not go well\u201d, \u201cI know the answers but I fail to write them in time\u201d among others. Assistant commissioner Krishna Pal Rajoot, an under-training IAS officer, the man behind the initiative, said that students should simply pick up the phone and feel free to call 9646470777 from 9 am to 9 pm, for any kind of assistance and counselling to deal with stress. \u201cTill now we have received over 200 calls and students feel better after speaking to the counsellors who have been trained for this purpose,\u201d he said. \u201cThese days, students are under a lot of pressure and stress to perform and score well. So, it is necessary for the parents, teachers and everyone around to make students realize that exams do not signify the end of life. The Fateh Helpline is giving a listening ear to such students who feel stressed,\u201d he added. Trinamool Congress leader Shahjahan Sheikh, wanted for land grab and sexual harassment cases, was arrested by West Bengal Police from Minakhan area. He had been on the run since January 5 when his supporters attacked ED officials. The Calcutta High Court had directed that he could be arrested by CBI, ED, or state police. Protests against his aides have caused tension between TMC and BJP.

minister Vikramaditya Singh announces resignation, later says won\u2019t press for it", "content": "Amid a fresh scramble for power in the state, Himachal Pradesh Public Works Minister Vikramaditya Singh on Wednesday announced thathe is quitting from the Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu cabinetbut hours later he said that he will not press for his resignation. \u201cI am submitting my resignation to the chief minister and the governor,\u201d he told reporters in the morning. Several hours later after meeting with the central observers, Singh said he would not press for the resignation. \u201cI have offered my resignation but the chief ministerSukhvinder Singh Sukhuhas not accepted it,\u201d he said. Vikramaditya Singh said the central observers have assured him that his concerns would be taken care of and he is not pressing for the resignation, and added that the organisation is more important than individuals. \u201cIn the larger interest, I will not press for my resignation,\u201d he told the media persons earlier in the day. Earlier, he had said there have been attempts from some quarters to humiliate and undermine him and, in spite of reservations, he supported the government. Troubles have been mounting on the Congress since Tuesday, when it lost the soleRajya Sabhaseat to theBJPwith six of its members cross-voting in the poll. Vikramaditya Singh, as he announced his resignation, said he was \u201cdeeply hurt\u201d with the transpiring going on over the past two days and said there is a need to ponder what went wrong for the Congress. He said he has apprised Congress presidentMallikarjun Khargeand party leadersPriyanka GandhiVadra andRahul Gandhiof the developments. The ball is now in the party high command\u2019s court, he added. \u201cThe Congress party had made promises to the people and we owe the responsibility to fulfil those promises. I would decide my future course of action after consulting my supporters,\u201d Vikramaditya Singh said. He said the 2022 assembly elections in the state was fought in the name of former chief minister Virbhadra Singh, also his father. \u201cThere was no poster or hoarding or banner which did not carry his picture. There was a full-page ad with his picture in the newspapers a day before voting,\u201d he said. But after the victory, when the matter of installing his statue arose, the government failed to decide the location. \u201cIt is not a political but an emotional thing for a son,\u201d Vikramaditya Singh said. He also quoted a couplet by the last Mughal Emperor of India Bahadur Shah Zafar: \u201cKitna hai bad-naseeb \u2018Zafar\u2019 dafn ke liye, do gaz zameen bhi na mili kuch-e-yaar mein.\u201d Fissures in the Congress has come to fore with some party leaders openly criticising the functioning of the Sukhu government. Vikramaditya Singh has been raising his concerns about functioning of the government while state Congress president Pratibha Singh, his mother, had been repeatedly pressing for rewarding the dedicated leaders of the organisation, who worked hard for the victory of the party. She even said party leaders and MLAs are unhappy as their concerns are not being addressed. Earlier, upset over the omission of some sections in thebudget, Vikramaditya Singh had blamed negligence on the part of some officers and said they had taken strong cognisance of it. He had told the PTI that multi-purpose workers of the public works department (PWD) have been left out in the budget and no reference has been made regarding the job-seekers sitting on dharnas for early declaration of results, a day after budget was presented. Two of the six Congress MLAs who cross-voted for BJP candidate Harsh Mahajan on Tuesday \u2013 Rajender Rana and Sudhir Sharma \u2013 were also vocal against the government and had supported the protest by the candidates awaiting declaration of results of several posts. Congress MLA from Sujanpur assembly seat, Rajinder Rana, had shot a letter to the chief minister saying that even after 14 months of formation of the government, the youths are still waiting for jobs. \u201cWe had promised to provide employment to one lakh youth every year. The youth of the state are eagerly waiting for the fulfillment of that promise\u201d, he had said in the letter also posted onFacebook. Vaqeel Hasan, leader of a team of miners who rescued 41 workers in Uttarakhand, returned home to find it demolished in an anti-encroachment drive. Despite pleading, his house was the only one targeted. Hasan, a father of three, emphasizes the need for unity after their heroic mission.

{"source": "Indian Express", "headline": "As talks on OPS fail, Sanjha Front to protest outside Punjab Vidhan Sabha", "content": "As the talks between the Punjab government and the Purani Pension Bahali Sanjha Front at Punjab Bhawan on Wednesday failed to yield a result on the Old Pension Scheme (OPS) demand, Sanjha Front members alleged that the government was \u201cneither prepared for the meeting nor committed to do anything for the employees\u201d and announced to protest outside the Vidhan Sabha on March 11. Jasvir Singh Talwara, convenor of the Sanjha Front, said, \u201cOnly Cabinet Minister Aman Arora, along with Finance Department officials, was present at the meeting. What decision could he make independently? Our meeting lasted for about 30 minutes. Now, we will protest outside the Vidhan Sabha on March 11 wearing black clothes.\u201d \u201cWhen asked when GPF accounts will be opened, the minister had no answer. Asked when NPS deduction will stop, he did not reply. They (AAP) had guaranteed the implementation of OPS in their poll manifesto. Punjab Chief MinisterBhagwant Mannhad on October 22, 2022 announced that he would implement the OPS and a notification was issued on November 18, 2022. However, no progress has been made since then, except for forming a committee and visiting a few states, which have implemented OPS,\u201d Talwara said. Atinder Pal Singh Ghagga, Jarnail Singh Bhatti and Gurjant Singh were among other Sanjha Front members who attended the meeting. The National Pension System (NPS) replaced the OPS on January 1, 2004. On Sunday, a mega rally was held close to the residence of the CM in his native district of Sangrur, following which a meeting was scheduled. Nearly 2 lakh employees of the Punjab government under the NPS are seeking the implementation of the OPS. \u201cWhen Finance Minister Harpal Singh Cheema was not free to attend the meeting, despite OPS being his subject, we wonder why they called us for the meeting\u201d Jarnail Singh Bhatti said. As theBudgetSession of the Punjab Assembly begins on March 1, several unions, including the Unemployed Sanjha Morcha, are likely to protest inChandigarhon March 4. Vaqeel Hasan, leader of a team of miners who rescued 41 workers in Uttarakhand, returned home to find it demolished in an anti-encroachment drive. Despite pleading, his house was the only one targeted. Hasan, a father of three, emphasizes the need for unity after their heroic mission.

businessman extortion case: Gujarat ATS arrests associate of suspended cop", "content": "The Gujarat Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS) on Wednesdayarrested an associate of suspended police inspector Taral Bhatt, the prime accused in the extortion of a Kerala-based businessman in Junagadh. The accused was identified as Deep Rajendra Shah, who allegedly helped Bhatt freeze over \u201c600 bank accounts for gaining illegal financial benefits,\u201d He also has a criminal history of various cases inAhmedabad. According to the Gujarat ATS, after Bhatt was arrested on February 2, it was revealed during interrogation that Shah helped him in the extortion. He was trying to escape the country after breaking all his phones and fleeing to Dubai to avoid arrest. The interrogation also revealed how the co-accused got in touch with Bhatt during one of the Madhupura cricket betting scandals. The case involves the alleged extortion of a Kerala-based businessman, Karthik Jagdish Bhandari, by police officials in Junagadh. Bhandari filed a complaint stating that the Junagadh Cyber Crime Cell had frozen his bank account, and police officials A M Gohil and ASI Deepak Jani demanded Rs 25 lakh in an extortion attempt. The businessman claimed that his calls to the cyber cell went unanswered, and he was advised to come to Junagadh in person. Upon arriving, he alleged that Jani tried to negotiate for 80 per cent of his bank balance to unfreeze the account, hinting at the involvement of the Enforcement Directorate. The co-accused helped Bhatt to get information on the bank accounts to freeze in the case to extort money and after the incident came to light, Shah helped Bhatt abscond by giving him false documents to stay in Ujjain-Indore, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh. The interrogation of Shah revealed the alleged involvement of aMumbai-based bookie named Birju Shah, who was into online cricket gambling from Dubai. Once he received Rs 27 lakh and Rs 9,84,000 on different dates through Angadia service, he sent them to Bhatt. It was also revealed that Shah received Rs 37,79,800 from Angadia for some \u201cunknown reason\u201d.

"Critically endangered yellow-breasted bunting sighted for first time in Gujarat\u2019s Nal Sarovar", "content": "A yellow-breasted bunting, a critically endangered species of bird which is commonly spotted in the Himalayan region and east and central Asia was sighted at Nal Sarovar Bird Sanctuary near Ahmedabad Wednesday, by a Bengaluru couple on a birding trip. This is only the second sighting of this bird in Gujarat and the first in Nal Sarovar, a wetland which is a Ramsar site. The small bird was sighted by tourist guides Shabbir Belim and Latif Belim who were guiding Roopa and her husband Ramchandra from Bengaluru, at Nal Sarovar lake on Wednesday morning. \u201cWe were clicking a flock of red-headed buntings and black-headed buntings when our guide told us to focus on one particular individual. On looking at it closely, he said it was a yellow-breasted bunting and that it was the first record of this bird in Nal Sarovar,\u201d Roopa, a homemaker, toldThe Indian Express. Yellow-breasted buntings have been categorised as an endangered species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature due to a rapid decline in its population. \u201cRed-headed and black-headed buntings migrate to India from central Asia during winters. But yellow-breasted buntings are not known to winter in Gujarat. Once can\u2019t say with certainty if the bunting seen in Nal Sarovar migrated with the flock of the buntings of the other two species or it is a vagrant,\u201d Prasad Ganpule, a senior birdwatcher of Gujarat said, adding, \u201cA yellow-breasted bunting was sighted in Pariege lake in 2019. That was the first record of this species in Gujarat and Wednesday\u2019s sighting at Nal Sarovar is only the second in the state.\u201d Shabbir said that he had been keeping an eye out for yellow bunting, which is a bird of agricultural fields, grasslands and wetlands. \u201cEvery year, flocks of migratory red-headed and black-headed buntings land in Nal Sarovar during winters. They roost in the wetland and forage in nearby paddy fields where crops have already been harvested. Senior birdwatchers had been telling me that Nal Sarovar and surrounding areas make an ideal habitat for yellow-breasted bunting also. Therefore, I was keeping an eye out for this species and had its reference photos on my phone. This particular individual from the flock flew closer to us. I requested my guests to photograph it. When they showed me the photos, I realised it was indeed a yellow-breasted bunting,\u201d said Shabbir. Roopa, whose husband Ramchandra is a retired Indian Forest Service officer, said that she had seen the bird in Assam around two months ago. \u201cBut that bird was not in breeding plumage while the one we saw in Nal Sarovar was a male in his breeding plumage. It was for the first time in my life that I saw this bird in its breeding plumage,\u201d she said. Bakul Trivedi, president of Bird Conservation Society of Gujarat (BCSG), said the sighting was another testament to the richness of Nal Sarovar as a habitat for a range of birds. \u201cThis is only the second record of a bird of this species in Gujarat and that shows how rare it is,\u201d Trivedi said, adding, \u201cNal Sarovar surprises one on every visit and that shows how rich the habitat is,\u201d he said. Wildlife biologist Bharat Jethva said the sighting adds one more feather to the cap of Nal Sarovar. \u201cThis means an addition to the checklist of bird species in Nal Sarovar. Birdwatchers will be happy to tick and click the species in this important wetland of Gujarat,\u201d said Jethva. Trinamool Congress leader Shahjahan Sheikh, wanted for land grab and sexual harassment cases, was arrested by West Bengal Police from Minakhan area. He had been on the run since January 5 when his supporters attacked ED officials. The Calcutta High Court had directed that he could be arrested by CBI, ED, or state police. Protests against his aides have caused tension between TMC and BJP.

leaving cotton swab inside woman during caesarean delivery", "content": "A doctor from a government hospital at Jambusar in Bharuch district was booked on Sunday for allegedly leaving a cotton swab inside a woman when she underwent a caesarean delivery last September. The doctor, meanwhile, has sent the husband of the woman a legal notice, seeking Rs 50 lakh, for \u201cdefaming\u201d her. The police said that Amisha Solanki was admitted to the sub-district hospital in Jambusar, where her parents stayed, on September 23, 2023. She was operated upon by Dr Charmi Ahir and gave birth to a boy. \u201cAfter she was discharged, she complained of stomach ache and was again taken to the hospital. The doctors gave her medicines and sent her back home,\u201d said police inspector AV Panmiya of Jambusar police station , adding that when the pain persisted, Amisha\u2019s husband Sailesh Solanki took her to a private hospital run by Dr Tushar Patel in Jambusar. \u201cThe doctors gave her medicines and she got temporary relief from the pain. Amisha then returned to in-laws\u2019 place inSurat. After a few days, she again complained of stomach ache. Shailesh then took her to Shyona diagnostic centre at Katargam where she underwent tests like sonography and CT scan. The reports showed there was a cotton swab in her stomach,\u201d the officer said. On November 22, 2023, the couple met Dr Ahir with the reports. She allegedly told Amisha to undergo an operation at the SSG hospital in Vadodara to get the swab removed. In his complaint to the police, Shailesh has alleged that when they reached SSG hospital the next day, \u201cthey did not get a positive response from the doctor\u201d and thus returned to Surat. On November 28, Amisha was admitted to Yashoda Hospital in Surat, where the cotton swab was removed from her abdomen through a surgery. Following this, Shailesh approached the Jambusar police station. On Sunday, Dr Ahir was booked under Section 338 (causing grievous hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) of the Indian Penal Code. Jambusar police Inspector A V Panmiya toldThe Indian Express, \u201cWe have registered an offence on the basis of Shailesh Solanki\u2019s statements and the medical papers he had submitted to us. We have also taken advice from SSG hospital before registering the offence. We have started recording the statements of Ahir as well as doctors at SSG hospital and in Surat.\u201d When contacted, Shailesh said, \u201cI had sent a notice to Dr Charmi Ahir through my lawyer in January and asked her to pay for all the medical expenses we have incurred. I also told her that if she fails to do so, I will take legal action.\u201d Following this, Dr Ahir \u2013 through her lawyers Vibhuti Panchal and Dhrupeshkumar Mistry \u2013 sent a legal notice to Shailesh, seeking Rs 50 lakh. Dr Ahir accused Shailesh of sharing the matter in the media, as a result of which, her and the hospital\u2019s reputation was damaged. She also claimed that all the allegations leveled by Shailesh are baseless. While Dr Ahir could not be reached for a comment, her lawyer Vibhuti Panchal said, \u201cDr Charmi Ahir received a notice from Shailesh Solank, in which he has accused her of negligence in her duty. We have replied to the notice and denied all allegations. We have also said that the image of Dr Ahir and the hospital has been damaged and we may file a defamation case\u2026 Though as of now, we are yet to file any defamation complaint.\u201d",

We are checking the CCTV cameras in the area. The accused allegedly entered the van, posing as an Income tax officer. He might have been given a tip-off by some insider and we are also probing in that direction.\u201d \u201cWe have taken statements of all the four employees who were travelling in the van. The Sahajanand firm employees took out cash from the Katargam vault and were on their way to deposit in another safe of a private company at Mahidharpura,\u201d he added.

After collecting the cash, they were headed to deposit the cash in the Nidhi Safe, another private vault, in Mahidharpura. Dudhat said the accused, after stopping the van, showed an identity card of an Income tax officer to Narayan. He boarded the van, then told Patel to drive the van, and took mobile phones from all four staff members. He also allegedly told them that one of their teams was carrying out raids in the administrative office of the company.\u00a0 He later asked all of them to get down from the van at gunpoint, and fled with the vehicle.

"Indian Express", "headline": "Anniversary of Gulberg society massacre: 22 years on, families look to move on, held back by memories", "content": "Twenty-two years since 69 people were massacred at Gulberg society in Ahmedabad during the riots of 2002, Rupa Mody is still awaiting the return of her son Azhar. Then 13, Azhar had gone missing from the society on February 28, 2002, during the riots. He was never found. Inside the family\u2019s dilapidated house at the society, Azhar\u2019s room still has faded stickers of WWE wrestlers, tightly glued on the door. Dara Mody (61), Azhar\u2019s father, silently stares out of their balcony after lighting incense sticks and praying at the shrine in the house. Dara says he makes it a point to visit the now abandoned house \u201cwhenever I pass through the area\u201d. Every year, who survived the massacre from the 18 homes of the society, mark the anniversary of the tragedy on February 28 by visiting their houses, honouring their loved ones. A day after the S6 coach of Sabarmati Express was burnt near Godhra station on February 27, 2002, killing 58 karsevaks, the Gulberg society saw a massacre, leaving 69 dead, including former Congress MP Ahsan Jafri. A trial court in 2020 had convicted 24 of the 66 accused in the case, including a VHP leader. However, remains of Jafri were not found. Salim Noormohamed Sandhi (73) lost four members of his family \u2013 his son Hussain, then in second-year of law college, two sister-in-laws and a brother. Since then, Salim\u2019s younger brother, who had survived the riots, had gone missing \u201cfollowing the trauma of the massacre\u201d. The family does not know whether he is alive. Salim, who drives an autorickshaw, says he \u201cmakes it a point to stop and spend some time\u201d at the area if he has to drop or pick up passengers from there. On Wednesday, while asking for a box of matches to light incense sticks, his wife Saira asks Salim if he will light them too. Salim goads her to go ahead and light them first. \u201cWith time, there is no point in holding onto physical reminders,\u201d Salim says. The couple now stays in rented premises at Shahibaug. The prime eyewitness in the case, Imtiyazkhan Pathan, on Wednesdy brought along his 21-year-old son Junaid, who is pursuing his undergraduate degree and also training in stenography. \u201cI had first come here when I was in Class VIII but wasn\u2019t very interested in the history then,\u201d says the 21-year old, who kept asking Imtiyazkhan about the day of the incident, as he ambled through the society. In 2009, Pathan had deposed before the trial court, submitting that seeking to be rescued, slain Congress MP Ahsan Jafri had called then chief minister and now Prime MinisterNarendra Modi, who in turn had abused Jafri minutes before he was killed. Prominently missing the annual visit were the members of the Jafri family. Tanveer Jafri, late\u00a0 Jafri\u2019s son, said over phone from Bengaluru that he was held up with work in the city. He added that while Zakia, Ehsan\u2019s wife, and their daughter Nishrin though initially planned to visit, they could not, as \u201cthey were not keeping well\u201d. Weeks before the general elections, IE 100, the list of the 100 most powerful Indians this year, maps the lay of the land \u2014 the BJP holding strong, the Opposition trying to hold it together.

{"source": "Indian Express", "headline": "16-year-old has a mission: Making mathematics simpler, fun to learn", "content": "After seeing her peers struggle with Mathematics, Class X student Jahnavi Mahana decided to start an initiative to help children understand mathematical concepts in a simpler and more interesting way. Mahajan, 16, a student at Mayo College Girls\u2019 School, said: \u201cI wanted to break the monotony of mathematics, and I started doing that through this initiative,\u201d she said. Named \u201cMathology: Simplifying Maths\u201d, Mahajan\u2019s initiative is aimed at improving children\u2019s education and also reaching out to students belonging to families below the poverty line. \u201cAt Mathology, we are passionate about creating an impact on society by providing quality education to children belonging to families below the poverty line. We provide a rigorous, comprehensive, and personalised learning environment for students to help them reach their full potential. Our project follows Indian government campaigns such as \u201cBeti Bachao Beti Padhao\u201d, and \u201cPadhega India Toh Badhega India\u201d for education to ensure that our students have the necessary skills to succeed. Our goal is to make sure that every child is given an equal chance to succeed in life,\u201d she added. Through the initiative, her team of 30 members that include 16-year-old Dia Parekh, 12-year-old Anjaneya Mahana, and 12-year-old Viraj Anand, has curated over 20 activities and conducted over 20 workshops, and reached over 7,000 students across 18 cities and three countries. \u201cWe strive to create a ripple effect of positive change that will have a lasting impact on their lives and the society at large,\u201d she said. During her interactive sessions with students, Mahana said she enjoys teaching backbenchers the most. \u201cBringing out untapped potential is different altogether,\u201d she added.

While his family claimed that Somesh, who was standing at the spot, died from a bullet injury amid police firing, the police denied the allegation. Rampur District Magistrate (DM) Jogindra Singh has ordered a magisterial inquiry. The condition of two injured persons, identified as Raheespal and Raman, both Dalits, is stable, officers said. The incident occurred when a team of the district administration and the police reached Silai Badha village on Tuesday to remove the board, which declared the plot as \u2018Ambedkar Park\u2019. The board, which also carried an image of Ambedkar, was set up around two months ago after levelling of the plot. A section of villagers, belonging to the Kurmi community (OBC), raised objections immediately after the board was set up and also filed a complaint with the district administration. The incident on Tuesday occurred when a team from the district administration, accompanied by the police, visited the village in connection with the complaint. The clash involved stone-pelting and gunfire, claimed a police officer. Three government vehicles were also damaged, added the officer. On Wednesday, Somesh\u2019s family members, along with some local residents, organised a protest in the village when the body was brought back after the post-mortem examination. Their demands included compensation of Rs 1 crore to the kin of the deceased, Rs 10 lakh to the injured persons and suspension of government officials allegedly responsible for the incident. The victim\u2019s family conducted the final rites only after senior officials in the district administration and the police assured them of all possible help and stringent action against the culprits. DM Jogindra Singh said the situation was soon brought under control, adding that all aspects would be looked into during the inquiry. Police personnel have been deployed in the village, which is Kurmi-dominated. On Tuesday, a team from the district administration and police went to the village to resolve the issue. Some members of the Dalit community soon reached the spot. When the administration team directed that the board be removed, heated arguments ensued between police personnel and the Dalit group, leading to an ugly turn of events when protesters allegedly started pelting stones. In the meantime, another group belonging to the Kurmi community arrived, and a clash ensued, police claimed. Somesh, who was standing near the spot, was hit on the head by a stray bullet and died instantly, officers claimed. As news of the death spread, local residents blocked the road. Additional police force was called to disperse the crowd. The body was sent for postmortem, and the report is awaited. On Wednesday, Somesh\u2019s father, Gedanlal, registered anFIRagainst 23 named persons, including four policemen, apart from unidentified followers and a homeguard of the sub-divisional magistrate and the local tehsildar on several charges, including murder and rioting, at the Milak Police Station. The police have also invoked the SC/ST Act in the case. Among the accused are a police sub-inspector, three police constables and local residents, mostly from the Kurmi community. A police officer mentioned that a preliminary inquiry revealed that the plot had been levelled by a few local residents. Dalits of the village were promised that an \u2018Ambedkar Park\u2019 would be established there. Since the board was put up, the Dalits had been requesting the administration to grant permission for installing a statue of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, police said. Rampur Superintendent of Police Rajesh Dwivedi said a detailed probe would be conducted in the matter.

Samajwadi Party: \u2018Support PDA slogan\u2019", "content": "FORMER BSP MLA Shah Alam alias \u201cGuddu Jamali\u201d on Wednesday joined the Samajwadi Party (SP) along with a large number of his supporters. Alam (50), a two-time MLA from Mubarakpur Assembly constituency, said he joined the SP because it \u201cis in the best interest of society\u201d. Addressing a press conference at the SP headquarters inLucknowalong with SP national presidentAkhilesh Yadav, Alam said, \u201cI have decided this (to join the SP) after my heart said that this is in the best interest of society. There are two camps in the country right now. One wants to divide and break the country. I want to say that 99 per cent of my friends are Hindu. I never felt we could be divided based on religion. My heart cries when it sees what is happening in the name of religion. And we must stand with those who are standing against this division, and I support the slogan of PDA (\u2018Picchde (backward classes), Dalits and Alpsankhyak (minorities)\u2019) by Akhilesh Yadav ji.\u201d Alam has been elected as an MLA twice for the BSP from Mubarakpur, but had parted ways with the party just before the 2022 Assembly elections in the state, when he was not given a ticket by the BSP to contest from the constituency. He had contested for the AIMIM, and had stood fourth when SP leader Akhilesh Yadav won the seat. He made a comeback to the BSP just before the bypoll for Azamgarh Lok Sabha seat the same year after the seat was vacated by Akhilesh to become the Leader of Opposition in the Assembly. In the 2022 bypoll for the Azamgarh Lok Sabha seat, Alam, who is a prominent builder, stood third after getting 2.6 lakh votes. He had played a big role in the defeat of SP\u2019sDharmendraYadav, who is a cousin of Akhilesh and a former MP from Budaun. Yadav had lost by just 8,679 votes toBJP\u2019s Dinesh Lal Yadav \u201cNirahua\u201d. With the entry of Alam, he is likely to contest from Azamgarh seat in the coming polls. Recently, the SP had changed party national general secretary and Akhilesh\u2019s uncle Shivpal Yadav\u2019s seat from Azamgarh to Budaun in order to accommodate Alam. In the 2022 state elections, Alam had declared assets of Rs 195.84 crore \u2013 making him the second-richest candidate in the UP poll fray. Welcoming Alam to the SP, Akhilesh Yadav said he works for the uplift of the downtrodden. \u201cThose in business never discriminate on the basis of religion or caste. Because businesses unite people. I am happy that a strong leader joined us,\u201d said Akhilesh. The DMK-led Tamil Nadu government has landed in a soup after an advertisement on Indian Space Research Organisation\u2019s (Isro) upcoming spaceport at Kulasekarapattinam in Thoothukudi district sported a rocket with a Chinese flag. The BJP has slammed the ruling Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) for the full-page ad that appeared in all leading dailies on Wednesday.

protection plea of married woman, live-in-partner, imposes Rs 2,000 cost", "content": "The Allahabad High Court recently dismissed a protection plea by a Muslim woman and Hindu man in a live-in relationship due to the woman\u2019s existing legal marriage and the absence of divorce evidence. A bench of Justice Renu Agarwal observed that \u201csuch type of illegal relationship need not be protected by court\u201d and imposed a cost of Rs 2,000 on the live-in couple. The 26-year-old Muslim woman and the 25-year-old Hindu man moved court with a protection plea on the ground that they are adults and living together on their own. The woman also stated that she left her husband\u2019s house along with her five-year-old daughter since he was a habitual drinker who regularly assaulted her. She said she complained about it to her parents but to no avail, so she started living with his live-in partner of her own free will along with her daughter. The petitioners also claimed that the woman\u2019s husband was threatening and disturbing their relationship. The woman said she had filed an application with the Aligarh police superintendent to provide protection to them, but no relief was given. The woman and her live-in partner then moved to the court, seeking direction to restrain her husband from interfering with their peaceful life. The court stated, \u201cThe court could not protect such a relationship that is not supported by law. If the court indulges in such type of cases and grants protection to illegal relationships, then it will create chaos in the society.\u201d The court said the woman left the house of her husband, who is one of the respondents in the case, without any reasonable cause. The standing counsel for the state government submitted that the woman had not obtained any divorce from her husband and she was still his legally wedded wife. The woman was living with the live-in partner in adultery, the counsel claimed. Weeks before the general elections, IE 100, the list of the 100 most powerful Indians this year, maps the lay of the land \u2014 the BJP holding strong, the Opposition trying to hold it together.

Indian Space Research Organisation\u2019s (Isro) upcoming spaceport at Kulasekarapattinam in Thoothukudi district sported a rocket with a Chinese flag. TheBJPhas slammed the rulingDravida Munnetra Kazhagam(DMK) for the full-page ad that appeared in all leading dailies on Wednesday ahead of Prime MinisterNarendra Modi\u2019s foundation stone-laying event of Kulasekarapattinam spaceport. Taking to X, BJP state president K Annamalai on Wednesday shared the poster and said the poster is a manifestation of DMK\u2019s commitment to China and displayed their total disregard to the country\u2019s sovereignty. Earlier, while addressing the gathering in Tirunelveli, PM Modi also criticised the DMK over the controversial advertisement saying the state government was turning a blind eye towards the nation\u2019s progress. \u201cDMK is a party that does not work but steers ahead to take false credit. Who doesn\u2019t know that these people paste their stickers on our schemes. Now they have crossed the limits, they have pasted China\u2019s sticker to take credit forISROlaunch pad in Tamil Nadu,\u201d Modi said who was on a two-day visit to Tamil Nadu to lay foundation stones and launch multiple development projects in the state. Annamalai said the DMK, which is steeped in corruption, has been desperate to paste stickers ever since the announcement of a spaceport in Kulasekarapattinam. \u201cThe amount of desperation only proves their attempt to bury their past misdeeds, but we must remind them that DMK was why the Satish Dhawan Space Centre is today in Andhra Pradesh and not Tamil Nadu,\u201d Annamalai wrote on X. This advertisement by DMK Minister Thiru Anita Radhakrishnan to leading Tamil dailies today is a manifestation of DMK\u2019s commitment to China & their total disregard for our country\u2019s sovereignty. DMK, a party flighing high on corruption, has been desperate to paste stickers ever\u2026pic.twitter.com/g6CeTzd9TZ \u2014 K.Annamalai (@annamalai_k)February 28, 2024 He claimed that when the first launch pad of Isro was conceptualised, Tamil Nadu was the first choice of the space agency and blamed former Chief Minister C N Annadurai\u2019s callous attitude for letting the space project go from the state. \u201cThis was the treatment our country\u2019s space programme received 60 years ago. DMK hasn\u2019t changed much and has only become worse,\u201d Annamalai said. Meanwhile, Thoothukudi MP Kanimozhi who participated in the event alongside Minister for Public Works E V Velu said it was disappointing that PM Modi did not have heart even to acknowledge their names. Commenting on the controversy, Kanimozhi said no one has yet declared China as India\u2019s enemy. \u201cSomeone who had done the artwork had put that (advertisement)\u2026 The Chinese Prime Minister is coming here and our Prime Minister is receiving him directly and they both go on a walk in Mahabalipuram. In such a scenario, no one has said till now that they have announced them (China) as our enemy,\u201d she told reporters atChennaion Wednesday. \u201cWe have the rights in the projects that were launched today and it (Kulasekarapattinam spaceport) was our leader Kalaignar\u2019s dream and hence we participated in that,\u201d she said. The advertisement featured PM Modi and Chief Minister M K Stalin in the background of a rocket emblazoned with a Chinese flag. The advertisement also featured the images of Kanimozhi and Youth Welfare and Sports Development Minister Udhayanidhi Stalin, Velu and Animal Husbandry Minister Anitha Radhakrishnan. It also carries words highlighting the efforts of DMK leaders, including former CM MKarunanidhi, his son M K Stalin and MP Kanimozhi in making the project become a reality. The DMK-led Tamil Nadu government has landed in a soup after an advertisement on Indian Space Research Organisation\u2019s (Isro) upcoming spaceport at Kulasekarapattinam in Thoothukudi district sported a rocket with a Chinese flag.

"https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chennai/madras-hc-second-bail-plea-former-tn-minister-senthil-balaji-dismiss-9185969/": {"source": "Indian Express", "headline": "Madras HC dismisses second bail plea of former TN Minister Senthil Balaji", "content": "The Madras High Court on Wednesday dismissed the second bail petition filed by former Tamil Nadu Minister V Senthil Balaji, who was arrested by the ED last year in connection with a money laundering case. This was the second time in four months, that the DMK leader\u2019s plea for the relief was rejected by the HC. Justice N Anand Venkatesh said, \u201cIn the light of the above discussion, this court does not find any merits in this bail petition and accordingly, the same is hereby dismissed\u201d. The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has identified the proceeds of crime at Rs.67.74 crores. \u201cIf the petitioner is let out on bail in a case of this nature, it will send a wrong signal and it will be against larger public interest. Therefore, this Court holds that even under Section 439 Cr.PC, the petitioner is not entitled to be considered for enlargement on bail\u201d, the judge added. The judge said the petitioner has suffered incarceration for more than eight months and therefore, it will be more appropriate to direct the Special Court, to dispose of the case within a time frame. Accordingly, there shall be a direction to the Principal Special Court,Chennai, to dispose of the case within a period of three months from the date of receipt of copy of this order. The trial shall be conducted on a day to day basis in accordance with the guidelines given by the Supreme Court in Vinod Kumar Vs State of Punjab case, the judge added. The judge said the court was not able to agree with the petitioner\u2019s contention that he has resigned as a Minister and therefore, the apprehension that he will tamper with the evidence and influence the witnesses, no longer subsists. Thepetitioner resigned from the post of Ministerwithout a portfolio just one day prior to the hearing of this bail petition. The fact that the accused continued to remain as a Minister for nearly eight months and that too without a portfolio when he was inside the jail, shows the tremendous influence of the petitioner and the importance that was given to him by the State Government, the judge added. The judge said even if the petitioner had resigned as a minister, he continues as a MLA belonging to the same party which was running the Government in the State and therefore, without any hesitation, \u201cthis Court holds that the petitioner continues to wield a lot of influence on the Government.\u201d When such was the position, the witnesses who were mostly the officials belonging to the Metropolitan Transport Corporation and the prospective job seekers who had paid the money, will be influenced/tampered with, the judge added. The court said the past conduct of the petitioner shows that in the predicate offence the complainant was made to compromise the dispute and only after the interference of the Apex Court, the predicate offences revived and it resulted in filing of the final reports. This past conduct also has a lot of bearing in this case, the judge added. The Court was also took into consideration the larger interest of the Public/State since the petitioner was involved in a cash-for-job scam by misusing his position as a Transport Minister and thereby, genuine aspirants for the job were deprived of level playing field and in their place, persons who paid money were accommodated. The judge said the final report has been filed in the predicate offences by relying upon the very same documents and the petitioner has never questioned the genuineness of those documents till date. The ED has merely collected those documents in the predicate offence and in order to add authenticity, it has also been certified by the Special Court dealing with the predicate offence. Therefore, this Court was not convinced that the ED has indulged in tampering with the electronic records or that such tampering had even taken place or any such thing had been done by it in the predicate offences, the judge added. There was a large scale manipulation resorted to which has been explained and it shows that payments have been made by many job aspirants for jobs either directly or through the associates to B Shanmugam and M Karthikeyan, who were the unofficial personal assistants of the petitioner during the relevant point of time, the judge added. He said if there was a prima facie material to show that the amount has been received by misusing the position of the petitioner who was the then Transport Minister, that by itself will be construed as proceeds of crime and it was not necessary for the ED to further establish that such proceeds of crime was projected as untainted money subsequently. The judge said the statements that have been recorded from the witnesses and which has been relied upon, was also a strong material that prima facie establishes the offence of money laundering against the petitioner.

that a ruling party functionary had links with an international drug cartel recently busted by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB). Earlier, news agency ANI quoted the NCB as saying that it seized 50 kg of pseudoephedrine during raids. NCB Headquarters in a joint operation with the Special Cell ofDelhiPolice and Operations Branch, busted a drug trafficking network involved in precursor chemical trafficking and seized 50kg of Pseudoephedrine. Three persons were arrested in this connection.

Three people have been arrested in New Delhi in connection to the crime and three others including Sadiq are absconding. Quoting media reports, Palaniswami alleged that Sadiq\u2019s brothers were also involved in the crime and the Enforcement Directorate has begun a probe into the matter. The AIADMK leader said Tamil Nadu was becoming a hub for drugs with many youngsters including school and college students getting addicted to drugs. Edappadi alleged that Sadiq was running a drug mafia from New Delhi and the police should conduct a detailed probe to find out who else received a share of the proceeds of the crime. BJPleader K Annamalai on Sunday had urged Chief Minister M K Stalin to release a white paper on the issue and extend his full cooperation to the Delhi Police in the matter. \u0b9f\u0bc6\u0bb2\u0bcd\u0bb2\u0bbf\u0baf\u0bbf\u0bb2\u0bcd, \u0b9a\u0bc1\u0bae\u0bbe\u0bb0\u0bcd 2,000 \u0b95\u0bcb\u0b9f\u0bbf \u0bae\u0ba4\u0bbf\u0baa\u0bcd\u0baa\u0bc1\u0bb3\u0bcd\u0bb3 \u0baa\u0bcb\u0ba4\u0bc8\u0baa\u0bcd \u0baa\u0bca\u0bb0\u0bc1\u0bb3\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bb3\u0bc8\u0b95\u0bcd \u0b95\u0b9f\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0ba4 \u0bae\u0bc1\u0baf\u0ba9\u0bcd\u0bb1 \u0b95\u0bc1\u0bae\u0bcd\u0baa\u0bb2\u0bcd, \u0baa\u0bcb\u0ba4\u0bc8\u0baa\u0bcd \u0baa\u0bca\u0bb0\u0bc1\u0bb3\u0bcd \u0ba4\u0b9f\u0bc1\u0baa\u0bcd\u0baa\u0bc1\u0baa\u0bcd \u0baa\u0bbf\u0bb0\u0bbf\u0bb5\u0bc1 \u0b85\u0ba4\u0bbf\u0b95\u0bbe\u0bb0\u0bbf\u0b95\u0bb3\u0bbe\u0bb2\u0bcd \u0b95\u0bc8\u0ba4\u0bc1 \u0b9a\u0bc6\u0baf\u0bcd\u0baf\u0baa\u0bcd\u0baa\u0b9f\u0bcd\u0b9f\u0bc1\u0bb3\u0bcd\u0bb3\u0ba4\u0bc1. \u0bb5\u0bbf\u0b9a\u0bbe\u0bb0\u0ba3\u0bc8\u0baf\u0bbf\u0bb2\u0bcd, \u0b87\u0bb5\u0bb0\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bb3\u0bcd \u0ba4\u0bae\u0bbf\u0bb4\u0b95\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bc8\u0b9a\u0bcd \u0b9a\u0bc7\u0bb0\u0bcd\u0ba8\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bb5\u0bb0\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bb3\u0bcd \u0b8e\u0ba9\u0bcd\u0bb1\u0bc1\u0bae\u0bcd, \u0b87\u0ba8\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0b95\u0bcd \u0b95\u0bc1\u0bae\u0bcd\u0baa\u0bb2\u0bbf\u0ba9\u0bcd \u0ba4\u0bb2\u0bc8\u0bb5\u0ba9\u0bbe\u0b95\u0b9a\u0bcd \u0b9a\u0bc6\u0baf\u0bb2\u0bcd\u0baa\u0b9f\u0bcd\u0b9f\u0bb5\u0bb0\u0bcd, \u0ba4\u0bbf\u0bae\u0bc1\u0b95\u0bb5\u0bbf\u0ba9\u0bcd \u0b9a\u0bc6\u0ba9\u0bcd\u0ba9\u0bc8 \u0bae\u0bc7\u0bb1\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bc1 \u0bae\u0bbe\u0bb5\u0b9f\u0bcd\u0b9f\u2026pic.twitter.com/n8mJNDnPqd \u2014 K.Annamalai (@annamalai_k)February 25, 2024  Meanwhile, DMK General Secretary Durai Murugan issued a statement dismissing Sadiq permanently from the party for \u201cindulging in activities that brought dishonour to the party\u201d.

brother-in-law and four other accomplices, police said on Sunday. All the five accused people have been arrested, they said. The victim, G Praveen, was surrounded by his wife\u2019s elder brother Dinesh and his friends near a bar at suburban Pallikaranai on Saturday night. The five-member gang inflicted serious injuries on Praveen using machetes and later fled the spot. Police personnel rushed Praveen to the Chromepet Government Hospital where he succumbed to his injuries. A preliminary probe by the police revealed that Praveen was an accused in a murder case in 2022 and that he married a woman in November 2023 against the wishes of her family members. Praveen and his wife belong to different communities. A special police team arrested all the five men at Mambakkam on the outskirts of the city Sunday morning. Further investigation is on, police said. Trinamool Congress leader Shahjahan Sheikh, wanted for land grab and sexual harassment cases, was arrested by West Bengal Police from Minakhan area. He had been on the run since January 5 when his supporters attacked ED officials. The Calcutta High Court had directed that he could be arrested by CBI, ED, or state police. Protests against his aides have caused tension between TMC and BJP.

loses Rs 2.5 crore after conman promises electoral bonds to \u2018fund party at centre\u2019", "content": "A former high court judge in Hyderabad lost Rs 2.5 crore to miscreants who promised \u2018bonds\u2019 in return for \u201cfunds to the party at the centre\u201d. As he received no electoral bonds or any favour in return as promised for the monetary contribution, he suspected the funds had been misappropriated. Based on a complaint from the former judge, Film Nagar police on Wednesday registered anFIRand started an investigation. In his complaint, Justice DSR Varma, former Judge of Andhra Pradesh High Court and High Court of Allahabad, has alleged criminal breach of trust, criminal misappropriation, and also cheating etc. According to him, one Narendran approached him and sought funds \u201cto the party in the centre which will be acknowledged in the way of bonds\u201d. Over some time in 2021, the judge\u2019s family transferred a total of Rs 2.5 crore to Narendran. According to the complainant, Narendran promised to \u201cplace me and my grandchildren in the US\u201d. He added that one Sarath Reddy collected the money. The grandchildren were allegedly promised favours in return for the contribution, \u201cout of regard for me as a former judge,\u201d he said. \u201cThe common grievance of my family, including me, is that despite collecting huge amounts no bonds have been issued to us despite my requests, nor any favour was done either to me or to my grandchildren in the US, which is not very relevant or significant\u2026This is a clear violation of the recent judgement of the Supreme Court deprecating the collection of amounts by way of electoral bonds,\u201d he said in the complaint.

BRS would clarify the doubts people had about the Kaleshwaram project, K T Rama Rao added. Claiming that there have been several instances of irrigation projects suffering damage in India, he demanded that the Telangana government carry out repairs to the Medigadda barrage and provide water to the farmers. The state government can conduct an inquiry into the damage in Medigadda barrage and take action accordingly, he said. K T Rama Rao claimed that a \u201csmall damage\u201d is being shown through a magnifying glass. Noting that a problem occurred in three out of the 84 piers in one (Medigadda) barrage, he claimed that an attempt is being made to gain political mileage by showing as if the whole project would be washed away. Kaleshwaram project comprises three barrages, 15 reservoirs and 21 pumping stations, Rama Rao said. \u201cWe have our doubts. Looking at the way (CM)Revanth Reddyis speaking and the statements being made, we feel that the (Congress) government has some conspiratorial thoughts. We feel that the government has an evil intent, a conspiracy that the three barrages of Kaleshwaram should wash away,\u201d he alleged. \u201cIn case the three barrages are washed away, by leaving them without carrying out repairs, during floods in the rainy season, we foresee a cheap way of thinking to say that those (structures) built by (former CM and BRS President) KCR have been washed away,\u201d he said. Telangana farmers should see through the \u201cconspiracy\u201d when a government says that it does not want to take up repairs (immediately) and that water would not be filled in the barrages, he claimed. The ruling Congress and BRS have been engaged in awar of wordsover the damage to some piers of the Medigadda barrage. The National Dam Safety Authority (NDSA) had found in November last year that the Medigadda barrage has been severely compromised, rendering it useless unless fully rehabilitated. CM Revanth Reddyhad alleged earlier this month that the Kaleshwaram project has become a \u201ctaint for the Telangana society\u201d due to the damage to its barrages, the cost escalation and poor planning during the previous BRS regime as shown in the reports of CAG, vigilance and others. The DMK-led Tamil Nadu government has landed in a soup after an advertisement on Indian Space Research Organisation\u2019s (Isro) upcoming spaceport at Kulasekarapattinam in Thoothukudi district sported a rocket with a Chinese flag. The BJP has slammed the ruling Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) for the full-page ad that appeared in all leading dailies on Wednesday.

Express", "headline": "Karnataka Bitcoin scam: ex-Bengaluru Crime Branch officer accused of attacking SIT personnel; another officer arrested", "content": "A police officer in Bengaluru, who has been named in a Bitcoin scam-linked case, has been accused of attempting to murder a member of the Special Investigation Team (SID) when he was trying to arrest him on Tuesday. The Karnataka Criminal Investigation Department SIT is seeking the custodial interrogation of K Sridhar Poojar, Deputy Superintendent of Police, who was the original investigating officer when a hacker Srikrishna Ramesh alias Sriki was arrested in November 2020 by the Bengaluru police Central Crime Branch in a case of buying drugs on the darknet. Poojar\u2019s anticipatory bail in a Bitcoin scam case was rejected on February 23 by a special court. He has been attempting to move the Karnataka High Court for anticipatory bail after the special court rejected his bail plea. In a complaint to the Bengaluru police, Bhaskar Ramu, Assistant Sub-Inspector, who was deputed to take Poojar into custody in connection with the case, has alleged the officer drove his car away even as the ASI clung onto it in an attempt to stop him. The Vidhana Soudha police have registered anFIRunder sections for attempt to murder, criminal intimidation and preventing a public servant from discharging his duties. Ramu and Inspector Anil Kumar were deputed by SIT officials this week to apprehend Poojar after his bail was denied last week and it received information that the officer was near the Bengaluru civil court. However, Poojar knocked down the motorcycle of the police officers and fled. Poojar was reportedly followed and found again near the Coffee Board junction in central Bengaluru by the policemen where the officer drove his car away even as the ASI clung onto the window of the car in an attempt to stop him. The SIT has named Poojar, inspectors Prashanth Babu, Chandradhar S R and Lakshmikanthaiah along with a private cyber expert K S Santhosh Kumar, who assisted the probe in the hacker\u2019s case in 2020, as accused under charges of illegal confinement, breach of trust and destruction of evidence in January 24First Information Report(FIR). The SIT arrested Babu and Santhosh Kumar on January 24, who were granted bail on February 23. On Wednesday, while the SIT arrested Lakshmikanthaiah, Chandradhar moved a court for anticipatory bail. Last week, the SIT also spoke to an IPS officer who was the supervising officer when the alleged Bitcoin scam took place. Sandeep Patil, who was the joint commissioner of police (Crime) when the alleged Bitcoin scam occurred, has denied association with the alleged crime involving Crime Branch officers. Trinamool Congress leader Shahjahan Sheikh, wanted for land grab and sexual harassment cases, was arrested by West Bengal Police from Minakhan area. He had been on the run since January 5 when his supporters attacked ED officials. The Calcutta High Court had directed that he could be arrested by CBI, ED, or state police. Protests against his aides have caused tension between TMC and BJP.

The bench observed that the state was required by law to fill RERA vacancies, noting that all RERA orders could be appealed, and said appeals had to be disposed of by the Appellate Tribunal within 60 days of receipt. Noting that no chairperson had been appointed to the Tribunal, the bench said, \u201d \u2026.plethora of petitions are preferred before this court\u2026\u2026There are huge number of cases pending before this court only on the score that the Tribunal is not functioning\u2026\u2026.Therefore the State by its act prima facie, is contributing to the pendency of cases before this court.\u201d The court subsequently recorded the assurance of the AG that the chairperson and other members would be appointed in three weeks, adding that the state should, without delay, identify the replacement for the member who is set to retire in April. The matter was set for further hearing on March 22. BCCI announces annual player retainership for 2023-24, with Ishan Kishan and Shreyas Iyer not included.

Zindabad\u2019 sloganeering charge against Congress MP\u2019s supporters rocks Karnataka Assembly", "content": "Karnataka Opposition leader R Ashok\u2019s allegation that Congress leader Syed Nasir Hussain\u2019s supporters chanted \u201cPakistan Zindabad\u201d after his election to the Rajya Sabha and Home Minister G Parameshwara\u2019s response to it led to protests and adjournment in the Assembly on Wednesday. \u201cThe incident of \u2018Pakistan Zindabad\u2019 sloganeering has created an atmosphere of fear in the state\u2026 If they raise such a slogan here (at the Vidhana Soudha), they will raise slogans in all streets of the state,\u201d Ashok said soon after the House convened in the morning. Despite the presence of a large number of police personnel and IAS and IPS officers, the people involved in the sloganeering were allowed to leave the Assembly premises, theBJPleader further alleged. \u201cWho let them escape? Who arranged vehicles for them?\u201d he asked. The BJP leader went on to question the Congress\u2019s decision to field Hussain in Tuesday\u2019s elections. As a few Congress MLAs objected saying that such slogans were not raised, Ashok demanded the government lodge a case against the media and himself if they were lying. \u201cThis incident is an insult to Kannadigas. The government was irresponsible,\u201d he said, demanding Chief MinisterSiddaramaiahtake moral responsibility for the alleged incident. BJP MLA V Sunil Kumar demanded the government hand over the probe to the National Investigation Agency. \u201cRecently, the government had invited Nitasha Kaul, who holds anti-India views, to a programme organised by the state government\u2026,\u201d he said, adding that the government\u2019s stance had emboldened \u201cthese people to raise such slogans\u201d. Though Parameshwara said action would be taken if it is proved in a forensic science laboratory that the slogans had indeed been raised, BJP MLAs protested in the well of the House, following which the Assembly was adjourned. Parameshwara said the incident should not have occurred. \u201cThere are two opinions about the sloganeering in the media. A suo motu case has been registered,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they had raised slogans we won\u2019t let them go scot-free. We will act against them as per law.\u201d For his part, Siddaramaiah also promised strict action if it is proved that such a slogan was raised. Congress general secretary Randeep Singh Surjewala accused the BJP of \u201cpeddling their favourite set of lowly lies of \u2018Pakistan Zindabad\u2019 slogans\u201d. He said the controversy stemmed from the BJP\u2019s \u201cextreme sense of exasperation\u201d and \u201cperverted mindset\u201d against minorities, particularly Muslims. \u201cThey are doing the same for Sikhs and Christians,\u201d he said, adding that his party condemned the \u201csinister and malicious agenda\u201d. Vaqeel Hasan, leader of a team of miners who rescued 41 workers in Uttarakhand, returned home to find it demolished in an anti-encroachment drive. Despite pleading, his house was the only one targeted. Hasan, a father of three, emphasizes the need for unity after their heroic mission.

"https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/artificial-intelligence/apple-ceo-tim-cook-promises-gen-ai-9187533/": {"source": "Indian Express", "headline": "Tim Cook to investors: Apple will \u2018break new ground\u2019 in Generative AI this year", "content": "At Apple\u2019s annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday, CEO Tim Cook said that the company is investing heavily in generative artificial intelligence, sending a clear message to investors that it wants to capitalise on the most buzzed-about technology. \u201cWe believe it will unlock transformative opportunities for our users when it comes to productivity, problem-solving, and more,\u201d Cook said atApple\u2019s annual shareholder meeting. In fact, Cook sees \u201cincredible breakthrough potential for generative AI.\u201d There\u2019s a lot of pressure on Apple to show evidence that the company is serious about Gen AI and can compete with its big tech peers, especiallyMicrosoftandGoogle. Investors want to know more about how Apple views the generative artificial intelligence space, which is the explosive breakout tech trend right now, capturing the attention of not only techies but also mainstream audiences. \u201cLater this year, I look forward to sharing with you the ways we will break new ground in generative AI, another technology we believe can redefine the future,\u201d Cook said. Cook\u2019s confirmation on the company\u2019s ambitions around generative artificial intelligence comes days after Apple reportedly shelved its electric car project, known as \u201cProject Titan\u201d internally. Cook previously called the secretive Apple Car project the \u201cmother of all AI projects.\u201d Big tech companies like Microsoft, Google, Nvidia, and Amazon are investing billions of dollars in General AI. Over the past few months, numerous chatbots and services have emerged, embedding generative AI into core products and services. However, tech companies have yet to show how the hype translates into profits. Cook didn\u2019t go into details on how Apple plans to bring generative artificial intelligence to the iPhone and other products. However, industry insiders speculate that Apple will disclose its AI strategy at its annual Worldwide Developer Conference in June, where it often unveils the upcoming software versions that power the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch. Apple is reportedly planning to upgrade Siri andiOS\u2019s built-in search tool, Spotlight, with GenAI models. The company is also said to be adding AI-powered features, allowing users to automatically generate presentation slides in Keynote and playlists in Apple Music, as well as GenAI-powered coding suggestions in Xcode, the company\u2019s app development platform. Apple has published open-source models and tools for developing GenAI-powered software in recent months. Bloomberg reported in October that Apple was investing $1 billion a year to catch up on GenAI, including efforts like a proprietary large language model called Ajax and an internal chatbot known as Apple GPT.iOS 18, the next version of the operating systemthat powers the iPhone, may bring GenAI-powered features to the world\u2019s most popular smartphone. Experts say Apple\u2019s entry into generative artificial intelligence may help scale up the reach of generative artificial intelligence massively. However, there are already concerns over AI ethics and accuracy that pose a major problem with how these Large Language Models (or LLMs) work. The recent issues surrounding theGeminiAI image-generation feature led Google CEO Sundar Pichai to publicly acknowledge the Gemini AI\u2019s inaccuracies, leading to its temporary removal for improvements. Weeks before the general elections, IE 100, the list of the 100 most powerful Indians this year, maps the lay of the land \u2014 the BJP holding strong, the Opposition trying to hold it together.

the best instant camera in 2024", "content": "There are still many who love the concept of owning a physical photo, which is why Polaroid cameras are making a comeback even in this digital era. These cameras allow users to click a picture and offer a physical copy of the picture instantly, hence they are also known as instant cameras. Unlike the late 90s, Polaroid cameras or instant cameras are no longer big and bulky. Instead, they are compact and come in unique shapes with their own character. Some cameras are as small as a keychain, and some devices look just like ones from the 1950s. When you take a picture using a Polaroid camera, the camera opens the shutter and lets the light hit the film, forming a negative image. The chemicals on the film, when exposed to sunlight, will develop into a beautiful picture. Depending on the light intensity, it could take a couple of seconds to a few minutes for the image to develop. If you have been looking around for a perfect instant camera, look for the following features to find one that suits your needs: While most instant cameras are simple devices that instantly print a picture, there are also plenty of instant cameras with smart features, which enable additional capabilities, including the ability to share photos to your smartphone, and cameras with displays that support quick edits. Some cameras even allow users to store digital photos on the device. Of course, a smart instant camera will cost a bit more than a regular version, which just prints out photos and does not offer any sort of preview or customisation of the pictures. Another important aspect to consider while buying an instant camera is the film format. Most instant cameras offer mini-sized photos. However, some cameras offer wide or square-shaped photos. Mini-sized photos will be vertical in format, wide photos will be horizontal, and square-shaped photos will have equal length and breadth. Do note that somebudgetinstant cameras do not include any film, which has to be bought separately. Hence, always choose one that comes with at least some films, ensuring that you can start taking pictures as soon as you get it. Just like smartphones, some instant cameras come with a rechargeable battery, while some require AAA/AA batteries. If you intend to use the camera a few times a year, then get one with a replaceable battery. Similarly, if you tend to use it daily, then we suggest a camera with a rechargeable battery. If you don\u2019t want to own an additional camera, you can also look at instant printers, which are pocketable devices that can be paired with your smartphone to instantly print a picture. Based on these parameters, here are some of the best instant cameras that one can buy in 2024: Priced at Rs 7,999, this is easily one of the most affordable instant cameras in the market, which comes with a 10-shot film. The Instax Mini 12 is available in multiple colour options, and it offers complete control over the picture, allowing users to adjust things like shutter speed, ISO, and flash intensity to capture the perfect photo at all times. It has a physical viewfinder and is suited for close-up shots with a distance of 30 to 50 cm. This is one of the most compact digital cameras that connects to an external device to print polaroids. The camera currently retails for Rs 10,999 and is available in five different colours, which can pair with the Instax Link Series Smartphone Printer. You can easily carry the Instax Pal in your pocket or you can even use it like a keychain. It has a rechargeable battery with a USB-C port, which makes it easy to charge. The printer is sold separately. This is a Polaroid camera with a digital display and looks like a classic 90s camera with a dual-tone finish. The camera currently costs Rs 19,999 and users can preview the picture before they choose to print it. If you are in the market for a smart instant camera, the Instax Mini Evo is the one to consider. This is a classic-looking instant camera that looks very trendy and premium but it is also on the larger side compared to the other options on this list. Right now, the camera is available on Amazon for Rs 17,400 and it is compatible with both i-Type and 600 film. Overall, this camera combines the past with the future and offers the best of both worlds. If you are not looking into a camera but just want a printer that connects to your smartphone and offers similar functionality, then a product like the Kodak Mini 3 Retro makes a lot of sense, which currently retails for Rs 12,000 and even includes 68 photo sheets. This device can be paired to anAndroidor an iPhone by downloading the Kodak photo printer app, which lets users print already existing phones from their smartphones.

for AI-powered India", "content": "Billionaire philanthropist and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates recently visited the Microsoft India Development Center (IDC), an innovation centre envisioned by him in 1988. This year IDC is celebrating its 25th year of groundbreaking research, engineering, and development. The centre based in Hyderabad, Telangana, is integral to its world-class products such as Azure, Windows, Office, Bing, Copilot, and other AI applications. \u201cIt was rewarding to watch Bill address some of India\u2019s brightest engineering minds at IDC, our biggest asset. Echoing his optimism over the opportunity for an AI-powered India, IDC is excited to drive innovation from India forMicrosoft\u2013 from AI and cloud to security and gaming,\u201d said Rajiv Kumar, Managing Director, Microsoft IDC, and CVP, Experiences + Devices India. Earlier this month, Microsoft chairman and CEO, Satya Nadella visited India and highlighted the country\u2019s growing significance in the development and deployment of AI. The CEO had said that India is second to the US when it comes to the total number of developers on GitHub and that it is going to cross that in 2027. \u201cIndia is a place where the momentum around developers and development is unbelievable,\u201d Nadella said to a packed crowd full of developers at an event in Bengaluru on Thursday. The underlying theme of the high-stakes event was the democratisation of AI, making it accessible and transforming lives and society at large. This sentiment is something that is relevant today, with IDC delivering pioneering research and development across various domains, including AI applications. Gates has been among the vocal advocates of the surge in AI. While he has listed the merits of this bustling technology on numerous occasions, the 68-year-old has also warned about the potential risks. The billionaire has expressed his thoughts on AI at length in his blog. Weeks before the general elections, IE 100, the list of the 100 most powerful Indians this year, maps the lay of the land \u2014 the BJP holding strong, the Opposition trying to hold it together.

"Daughter\u2019s emotional use of Snapchat filters on deceased father\u2019s photo sparks online debate", "content": "A recent incident has left netizens stunned and questioning the way people behave online. A young girl took toSnapchat to apply various filters to a photo of her late father, resulting in a video that has sparked widespread controversy and concern. The video, which quickly went viral across multiple platforms, shows the girl playfully using Snapchat\u2019s array of filters on a photograph of her deceased father. From cartoonish animations to comical distortions, the filters transform the solemn image of her father into something surreal and unsettling. Netizens were quick to react, with many expressing shock and disbelief at the girl\u2019s actions. Some condemned the behaviour asdisrespectful and insensitive, while others voiced concerns about the implications of such a trend on mental health and grief processing. Watch the video below:   A post shared by Sarcastic School | Updates \u2013 Hari Ram Singh (@sarcasticschool_) \u201cWhat\u2019s so wrong with people, she might be missing her father, she doesn\u2019t seems like making fun of him, it\u2019s her way to connect,\u201d remarked one user. Another added, \u201cPeople could just mind their business..\u201d A third user in support of the girl, wrote, \u201cMissing someone doesn\u2019t mean thinking of them and crying only,it seems like she thinks her father is still with him,it takes a lot time to be in this phase.it is totally her emotion and no one has any right to judge.\u201d A fourth user added, \u201cBruh I showed this to my father and he said that he finds it really heartwarming and cute. People process grief differently and probably she had a very good relationship with her father and missed him.\u201d Weeks before the general elections, IE 100, the list of the 100 most powerful Indians this year, maps the lay of the land \u2014 the BJP holding strong, the Opposition trying to hold it together.

"Indian Express", "headline": "Life in a Foreign University | Transitioning from DU lecturer to PhD candidate at Stanford", "content": "\u2014 Anubha Anushree Like many other Indian students, even I transitioned from the Indian education system to the Western education system (US, in my case), however, my transition was slightly different as I shifted from being a faculty at the Department of English, University ofDelhito pursuing a PhD with the Department of History, Stanford University. I graduated in English Literature from the University of Delhi with a gold medal. I pursued MA and MPhil as well from DU. I was a Fulbright Scholar to the US in 2009-2010. I then taught briefly at the Rajdhani College. And now, I am studying in the US and also have a teaching position here. My decision to pursue a PhD after my tenure at Rajdhani College was driven by professional necessity and passion for the subject. Academically, securing a doctoral degree is a prerequisite for advancement in academia, a realm where I aim to deepen my impact. Moreover, my fascination with history and a specific interest in the Kaithi script, a historical script from Bihar that has largely been forgotten, motivated me to embark on this research journey. My aspiration was not only to contribute academically but also to play a role in the preservation and revival of this script. However, this transition from a full-time academic position to a student role was full of challenges. The social dynamics on campus, such as the prevalence of late-night partying, were not particularly appealing to me. Additionally, I have to re-evaluate my living arrangements and lifestyle, including adjusting to shared housing and managing a tighterbudget. Despite these challenges, returning to academia as a student opened up a valuable opportunity for introspection and growth. It allowed me to reassess my previous learning and teaching experiences, identifying areas for improvement and expansion. This transition was about adapting to a student lifestyle and embracing profound personal and professional learning. My arrival in the US was far from smooth, marred by the ordeal of tracking down lost luggage and the struggle to establish communication with my family without an international phone number. One of the first things to notice about this place, especially the university campus, was the silence. There is a psychological shift that you need to prepare yourself for when you travel abroad. Yet, the mild climate of California\u2019s fall provided a comforting similarity to the weather back home in India, albeit in a much cleaner setting. The initial week was packed with socialising and networking opportunities, thanks toStanford University\u2018s exceptional international student centre, the Bechtel Center.  Surprisingly, I experienced little culture shock at first, perhaps because the differences were so vast and overwhelming that I hadn\u2019t had the time to process them fully. However, the reality of food prices on campus soon hit hard. Unlike the Indian campuses, meals at US universities are not only unsubsidised but can sometimes be more expensive than eating out. This, coupled with the arduous trudging to the university campus without any public transport, presented a steep learning curve for me. Fortunately, securing accommodation was straightforward, thanks to Stanford\u2019s supportive housing policy for international students. However, grocery shopping posed a challenge due to the sparse public transport options and the distance to stores. Over time, this became easier with the advent of shopping apps and the support of the local Indian community in the Bay Area. To manage my finances effectively, I used to cook regularly at home. This allowed me to maintain a healthier diet as well. Additionally, relying on public transportation has necessitated meticulous planning but has significantly reduced my travel expenses. Beyond these personal savings measures, seeking funding opportunities and applying for grants have been crucial in offsetting living costs. Among the myriad experiences, one stands out for its warmth and the unexpected friendship it sparked. While learning to swim at Stanford\u2019s facilities, I found myself struggling in the water one afternoon. A kind lady, in her late 50s, came to my aid, guiding me safely back to the poolside. Her encouragement and subsequent friendship became a cherished part of my journey, and she later became my regular swimming companion. My tenure as a Fulbright Scholar in the US marked a pivotal first journey abroad, imbuing the experience with novelty and discovery. The Fulbright Program is renowned for its role in fostering the exchange of Indian languages at American universities, a legacy I contributed to by teaching Hindi. This initiative expanded my academic horizons and allowed me to forge lasting friendships with students who were eager to learn from me. The United States-India Educational Foundation (USIEF) played a crucial role in this endeavour, meticulously preparing us for the transition to living abroad. This support was invaluable, especially for those among us who had never before experienced life outside India. The program facilitated introductions to faculty and departments, laying the groundwork for potential future collaborations. However, my Fulbright year was about more than academic networking and teaching; it was a profound lesson in the privileges and challenges of international living. It offered me firsthand insight into the dynamics of American classrooms, where I adapted my teaching strategies to engage students unfamiliar with Indian culture. The Fulbright experience was instrumental in teaching me the practicalities of daily life in the US, from navigating laundry services to understanding the public transport system. These everyday victories, though small, were significant milestones in my journey. Perhaps the most enriching aspect of my Fulbright year was the opportunity to immerse myself in a melting pot of cultures. Living with a Korean roommate, befriending individuals from the Philippines and Kenya, and exploring the US through this multicultural lens offered a unique perspective on American life. This exposure to diverse cultures was the highlight of my time abroad, teaching me the value of inclusivity and the beauty of global camaraderie. One of the most significant adjustments at Stanford University was adapting to the quarter system, where courses are condensed into 10 weeks, as opposed to the semester system prevalent in India. This change required me to develop new strategies for managing my time and workload, especially given the dense and challenging readings common in Humanities courses. Another notable difference was the emphasis on class participation and discussion in the smaller class settings at Stanford. This environment fostered a sense of accountability and engagement that I found both challenging and enriching, contrasting with the sometimes larger and less interactive classes in India. One area where I felt underprepared was in academic writing and presentation skills. The Indian education system, especially in public universities, often lacks a structured approach to teaching writing. In contrast, at Stanford, students across all disciplines have to take comprehensive writing and composition courses, which I believe significantly contribute to their ability to produce scholarly work. This focus on writing and productivity is something I feel Indian education could benefit from, to enhance the quality and quantity of research output. However, it\u2019s important to acknowledge the strengths of the Indian education system as well. My time at Delhi University, for example, was instrumental in developing my ability to think critically and creatively. The semester system, despite its drawbacks, allowed for deeper and broader engagement with the material, a practice that has served me well in my research endeavours. Furthermore, the lively debates and discussions with peers in India played a crucial role in preparing me to articulate my thoughts and challenge existing perspectives in a classroom setting. US universities offer a lot more institutional support and help to students, especially their focus on mental health and quality of life. However, students here work individually and sometimes, it could get a little isolating. Indian universities have more robust, albeit sometimes unstructured, peer-to-peer support networks. My teaching experience in the US has been very productive. I have especially enjoyed the autonomy of designing a class entirely on my own. Classrooms also are much more discussion-oriented here and therefore, I have had the opportunity to learn from some of my excellent students. Another interesting aspect of teaching in the US is to familiarise yourself with many teaching technologies. The variety of educational technologies I have become familiar with in the course of my teaching here would benefit Indian classrooms so much. The students here are much more tech savvy but I have also noticed they could be less inclined to try new things just because they may have more entrenched preconceived notions about new topics and ideas. So, teaching could be overwhelming sometimes but, overall I have enjoyed this experience very much.

{"source": "Indian Express", "headline": "Extension in compensatory time, relaxation in attendance: CISCE releases new guidelines for students with special needs", "content": "The Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) today released guidelines to address difficulties in students with special needs. The compensatory time provided to the students in the board exams has been increased to 20 minutes from 15 minutes and they have been given relaxation in attendance on a case-to-case basis. The guideline document is titled \u2018CISCE Guidelinesfor Comprehensive Support Measures in Examinations: Concessions and Benefits for Diverse Needs Learners\u2019. The board, in a statement, said that they aim to create a more inclusive and supportive learning environment for all students by encompassing diverse learning needs. As part of the new guidelines, the board will now give special consideration to students with Autism Spectrum Conditions for prior access to examination rooms and seating and provisions for ensuring rapport-building with their respective reader/reader cum writer/writer/adult prompter. Additionally, earplugs/earmuffs are to be made available to students with Autism Spectrum Conditions to manage environmental distractions. This initiative by the council seeks to acknowledge the diverse learning needs in schools and aims to expand the scope of support offered to students during examinations. Reiterating that it has been customary to provide concessions and benefits for students with benchmark disabilities as covered by the RPWD Act 2016, CISCE added: \u201cRecognising the evolving landscape of learning needs and the limitations of relying solely on disability classifications mentioned in the Act, the CISCE has taken a landmark decision to expand the scope of its Guidelines to include learning needs associated with disability conditions not falling under benchmark disability status, and Borderline Intellectual Functioning (BIF).\u201d Trinamool Congress leader Shahjahan Sheikh, wanted for land grab and sexual harassment cases, was arrested by West Bengal Police from Minakhan area. He had been on the run since January 5 when his supporters attacked ED officials. The Calcutta High Court had directed that he could be arrested by CBI, ED, or state police. Protests against his aides have caused tension between TMC and BJP.

"https://indianexpress.com/article/education/national-science-day-andhra-highest-pass-percentage-board-exams-science-9164752/": {"source": "Indian Express", "headline": "National Science Day: Andhra Pradesh records highest pass percentage in board exams (science), here\u2019s why?", "content": "National Science Day 2024 February 28:Every year, nearly 52 lakh students appear for Science stream exams, of which approximately 6 lakh students are from CBSE and 47,000 from CISCE. The rest are the state board students. As per the data released by the Department Of School Education & Literacy, the Ministry of Education, Andhra Pradesh records the highest passing percentage in theScience stream. In the 2022 report compiled by the Centre, 75.63 per cent students cleared the Science stream from Andhra Pradesh. The state has seen a constant rise as the number increased from 73.92 per cent in 2018 to 75.22 per cent in 2019, and even though there was a slight decrease during the Covid time (71.67 per cent in 2020 and 70.07 per cent in 2021), the number once again jumped in 2022.  \u201cAndhra Pradesh puts a lot of focus on students\u2019 education. If you visit the state, you will find coaching centres in almost every lane. Everyone wants to head to the US for their higher studies. To achieve their study abroad dreams, they ensure that their board exam result is good, which reflects in the pass percentage, especially in Science,\u201d says SS Mantha, former AICTE Chairman. This is followed by Manipur where 68.87 per cent students cleared theboard examin 2022, which is an increase from 2021\u2019s pass percentage of 68.42 per cent. However, this was a decline from the previous years where the pass percentage had been 71.39 per cent in 2020, 72.67 per cent in 2019 and 71.95 per cent in 2018. Manipur is followed by Telangana at 64.59 per cent, Tamil Nadu at 61.5 per cent and Uttar Pradesh at 57.48 per cent. However, the situation is slightly different when it comes to enrollment, and the number of students who pass their exams from the Science stream. Uttar Pradesh (UP) has registered the highest spot with 11 lakh students passing in the Science stream, followed by 6.1 lakh in Maharashtra, 4.79 lakh in Tamil Nadu, 4.25 lakh in Bihar. In between is also CBSE with 6.64 lakh registrations across the nation.  The contrast in the number of students passed and the passing percentage ranking is majorly due to the number of students appearing for the exams. Experts believe that there are certain states where the dropout rate in schools is higher than the rest which leads to low enrollments and therefore increased pass percentage. According to the data made available by the government in December 2023,over 29 lakh students have failed to clear Class 10 exams in the past year. The number of students who have failed to qualify the Class 10 exam has increased in the last four years \u2014 it was 10,9,800 in 2019, 1,00,812 in 2020, which decreased to 31,196 in 2021 but jumped drastically to 1,17,308 in 2022. The states which have seen increased number of school dropout rates are Assam Board of Secondary Education, Bihar School Examination Board (BSEB), Chhattisgarh Board of Secondary Education, Gujarat Secondary & Higher Secondary Education Board, Board of School Education Haryana (HSEB), Maharashtra State Board of Secondary & Higher Secondary Education, Board of Secondary Education Madhya Pradesh, Madhyamik Shiksha Parishad Uttar Pradesh and more. Mantha believes that the enrollments have gone down due to an increase in the cost of education in several states, and also due to a decrease in the number of government schools. \u201cSome states such as Maharashtra have seen a decline in the number of government schools as more private schools are opening up. This has increased the cost of education in the country, which leads to a decline in enrollments and rise in the dropout rate. States like Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, where the fees is less, are bound to see an increase in registrations,\u201d he said. He also shared that in a study conducted by AICTE back in his time, the survey showed that students of North East were not willing to take up hardcore skills courses, and therefore the registration in Science would be less as compared to other states which are also thickly populated. The same is proven by the data as states such as Manipur, Mizoram, Assam, Meghalaya, Nagaland, and Tripura do not feature in the top 10 of the list of total number of students who passed the Science stream. Manipur which is on the second spot in terms of share of pass out students only has 18,518 students who passed the exam. The number of students who passed the Science stream in Mizoram was 1676, 30956 in Assam, 2116 in Meghalaya, 1899 in Nagaland and 3441 in Tripura. Trinamool Congress leader Shahjahan Sheikh, wanted for land grab and sexual harassment cases, was arrested by West Bengal Police from Minakhan area. He had been on the run since January 5 when his supporters attacked ED officials. The Calcutta High Court had directed that he could be arrested by CBI, ED, or state police. Protests against his aides have caused tension between TMC and BJP.

"https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/what-consumption-expenditure-survey-leaves-unanswered-9187003/": {"source": "Indian Express", "headline": "What consumption expenditure survey leaves unanswered", "content": "How do Indians divide their consumption expenditure across categories? How many are below the poverty line? How has the picture changed over time? Answers to such questions have always been drawn from the quinquennial consumption expenditure surveys. After a decade-long hiatus, a factsheet based on the revamped and much awaited Household Consumption Expenditure Survey (HCES) for 2022-23 has been released. Based on the factsheet data, can we decisively answer these and other such questions? Not really, for reasons explained below. This piece comments on a few key takeaways. The factsheet gives a useful glimpse into present patterns of household consumption. There have been quick comparisons with earlier rounds of the consumption expenditure survey, especially with the last publicly available 68th round in 2011-12, to deduce a dramatic reduction in poverty over time and/or drastic changes in consumption patterns. Such comparisons are premature \u2014 the full data has not been released and there are several changes in item coverage, survey design and methodology. The 2011-12 round covered 347 items of consumption compared to 405 in HCES. Such revisions have been done in the past too and are par for the course as consumption habits change over time. There are three major changes that make the current survey non-comparable with its predecessors. First, the earlier rounds had one single questionnaire to cover expenditure on all items. The new HCES has three separate surveys on food items, consumable and service items and durable goods respectively. Second, the HCES involved multiple separate visits to households. As data collection methodologies, both these changes are welcome because it is well-known that respondent fatigue with long questionnaires in a single sitting leads to poorer responses. Shorter and more focused questionnaires elicit more precise answers. However, these changes have implications for comparability \u2014 these are likely to yield higher estimates compared to previous rounds. To check for the magnitude and direction of this upward bias, ideally the HCES should have chosen a subset of households to which the older survey with its single-visit design should have been administered. A comparison between the older and revised methodologies would have given us the magnitude of the difference. The third difference between HCES and earlier rounds relates to imputed values for items received or consumed free of cost through various social welfare programmes. These items range from staples like rice, wheat to footwear, laptops, and motorcycles. We can\u2019t assess the validity of this until unit-level price and quantity data are released. We can examine the HCES data for within-survey indicators, that is, inequality. Average all-India urban monthly per capita consumption expenditure (MPCE) at Rs 6,459 in 2022-23, is roughly 72 per cent higher than in rural areas (Rs 3,773). The corresponding figure was 84 per cent in 2011-12. This seems to indicate a decline in rural-urban inequality over the decade. However, there are two caveats. This does not account for the rural-urban price differential, which can fluctuate. Additionally, a longer view reveals that the rural-urban gap tends to fluctuate. From 75.9 per cent in 1999-2000, it rose to 90.8 in 2004-05, and then declined to 83.9 in 2011-12. We don\u2019t know if the ratio increased or decreased in 2017-18. How has the distribution of consumption expenditure changed over the decade? In 2011-12, the ratio of the 10th percentile of the rural expenditure distribution (Rs 710) to the 90th percentile (Rs 2,296) was 0.31. This ratio is 0.33 in 2022-23 (Rs 1,782/Rs 5,356). In other words, the consumption expenditure of the bottom 10 per cent of the rural distribution is roughly one-third of the top 10 per cent \u2014 a ratio that has not changed substantially over the decade. For urban areas, the corresponding ratio was 0.21 in 2011-12, which has risen to 0.27 in 2022-23, indicating a reduction in urban inequality. What about inter-caste differences? The ratio of average rural Scheduled Caste (SC) MPCE to that of the higher-ranked castes was 0.73 in 2011-12. This has remained unchanged at 0.7 in 2022-23. For rural Scheduled Tribes (ST), this ratio has improved marginally from 0.65 to 0.69 and for Other Backward Classes (OBC), from 0.83 to 0.87. While rural India does not show a marked narrowing of inter-caste gaps in MPCE, the urban figures suggest a narrowing of inter-group MPCE gaps: For SCs, the ratio increased from 0.63 to 0.72; for STs, from 0.68 to 0.74 and for OBCs, from 0.7 to 0.84. The factsheet reveals that in rural India, the percentage share of cereals \u2014 a food staple \u2014 in average MPCE is now 4.91 per cent and 3.64 per cent in urban India, compared to 10.75 per cent and 6.66 per cent respectively in 2011-12. This is accompanied by an increase in the share of processed foods and beverages. Overall, HCES indicates a decline in the share of food expenditure over the decade, which stands at 46 per cent in rural and 39 per cent in urban India. What are the items whose share in total expenditure has increased? Medical expenses on hospitalisation, conveyance, consumer services and durable goods in rural India. In urban India, the share of paan, tobacco and intoxicants, conveyance and durable goods has increased. The release of the survey findings, however limited, is a welcome development. For data to inform policy and analysis of well-being, this should be followed up by a quick release of the full price and quantity unit-level data for 2022-23, as well as from the follow up survey for 2023-24. As the economy diversifies and grows, it is only natural that consumption habits change and our surveys need to be able to capture that. However, as the adage goes, for surveys to measure change, the change in the survey instrument must be minimal. Combining these two imperatives is not impossible, as long-standing longitudinal panel surveys from other countries show us. The HCES has introduced welcome changes in survey design, but missed the opportunity to build the concordance bridge to previous rounds.

"https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/ai-sovereignty-and-isaac-asimovs-warning-9187012/": {"source": "Indian Express", "headline": "AI, sovereignty and Isaac Asimov\u2019s warning", "content": "Isaac Asimov\u2019s classic I, Robot (1950) insightfully explored the ethical and moral implications of robotics and artificial intelligence. The book\u2019s interconnected stories about robots guided by the Three Laws of Robotics highlight the challenges in ensuring AI\u2019s safety and alignment with human values. Asimov illustrates the limitations of these laws and AI\u2019s unpredictable nature, with quotes like, \u201cYou can\u2019t argue with a robot. They\u2019re terribly rational\u201d, reflecting concerns about AI acting against human interests. The book forces one to ponder about the dangers of AI being manipulated by adversaries, potentially turning against humans. As a fictional yet prescient work, I, Robot underscores the importance of ethical standards and security measures in AI development to prevent it from undermining national sovereignty. Since algorithms are devoid of national allegiance or moral judgement, the challenge before the world is not just to develop this technology but to develop the frameworks to ensure it serves humanity and not the other way around. The lack of a unified global framework for overseeing AI, coupled with the absence of national-level regulatory measures, poses a significant risk to national security and sovereignty in four distinct ways. First, AI is reshaping traditional notions of sovereignty, challenging the power dynamics between states, private technology companies, and individuals. As AI systems become more autonomous, they are creating new digital spaces that are not governed by traditional laws or state control. These digital spaces, defined by code and data, can be seen as new forms of sovereignty where power is wielded by those who control the AI systems. The emergence of AI has ushered in a new era of digital sovereignty, fundamentally altering the concept of territorial sovereignty. This transition impacts how nations control their digital domains and AI technologies. Countries lacking in AI development and regulation may find themselves reliant on more advanced nations, risking their sovereignty across sectors like defence, infrastructure, and healthcare. Additionally, the rise of AI shifts power from states to private tech companies and individuals who dominate these digital spaces. Though these entities don\u2019t possess traditional sovereignty, their influence challenges state authority and could reshape global political dynamics. Second, AI has the potential to significantly impact democracy, particularly when leveraged by foreign powers. It can be used to manipulate information and influence public opinion, which is a critical aspect of democratic societies. For example, AI can generate disinformation and misinformation at scale, which can trigger tensions and even electoral-related conflict and violence. Such AI-driven false information can spread biases or opinions that do not represent public sentiment, thereby affecting the democratic process negatively. Moreover, foreign powers can utilise AI to conduct influence campaigns that are more sophisticated and less detectable. These campaigns can exacerbate divisions within societies, seed nihilism about the existence of objective truth, and weaken democratic systems from within. The borderless nature of AI makes it difficult to control or regulate, and as AI technology becomes more advanced, it could be used by authoritarian regimes, terrorist groups, and organised crime groups to cause great harm. Third, Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems (LAWS), often termed \u201ckiller robots\u201d, present a profound threat to national security and sovereignty, raising critical ethical and technical challenges. From a technical standpoint, LAWS, equipped with advanced AI algorithms, can independently search for, identify, and engage targets without human intervention. This capability poses a risk of unintended escalation in military conflicts, as these systems might act based on pre-programmed criteria, lacking human judgement and context awareness, potentially leading to indiscriminate or erroneous targeting. Moreover, the risk of hacking or malfunctioning of these systems could result in catastrophic incidents,\u00a0undermining national security. Ethically, the deployment of LAWS challenges the fundamental principles of humanitarian law and responsibility. The absence of human oversight in the decision-making process of life and death raises significant moral questions about accountability. The principle of distinction, a cornerstone of international humanitarian law, mandates the differentiation between combatants and non-combatants. LAWS, reliant on algorithms for decision-making, may lack the nuanced understanding necessary to make these distinctions, risking civilian lives and violating international norms. The proliferation of LAWS could lead to an arms race, destabilising international peace and security. As these weapons become more accessible, the barrier to entering conflicts lowers, potentially leading to increased warfare and undermining national sovereignty. The lack of regulation and control over LAWS also presents a threat to the global order, as non-state actors might acquire and use these systems for terrorism or insurgency. This autonomy undermines deterrence theory, which relies on rational human actors to maintain balance and avoid conflict through the threat of retaliation. The unpredictability of LAWS disrupts this balance, potentially leading to uncontrolled escalations. Furthermore, the prospect of an arms race in autonomous weapons technology threatens global stability as nations prioritise technological advancement over diplomatic and strategic equilibrium. Fourth, the integration of AI into cybersecurity represents a dual-edged sword, where its potential for sophisticated cyberattacks directly threatens national security and sovereignty. AI-enhanced methods, such as advanced persistent threats and spear phishing, can penetrate and disrupt critical national infrastructures, undermining the stability and functioning of a state. Such disruptions not only pose immediate security risks but also threaten the economic and social well-being of nations. These threats extend beyond physical borders, as cyberattacks can originate from any location, making safeguarding national interests in the increasingly interconnected digital world challenging. The implications for national security are profound, requiring nations to reassess their cybersecurity strategies and invest in advanced defences. Safeguarding against these AI-enhanced threats is crucial for maintaining national sovereignty, ensuring that states retain control over their critical infrastructure, information systems, and the democratic processes that define their governance. In light of these challenges, it becomes evident that the world urgently requires a robust global AI governance body. Such an entity is essential to ensure that AI advancements serve humanity\u2019s broader interests, rather than the contrary. Alongside this, there is a critical need for evolving national-level regulations tailored to address AI\u2019s unique threats to sovereignty and national security.

polls: Opposition breaking and BJP winning", "content": "The Rajya Sabha election show on Tuesday was riveting \u2014 and immensely sobering. Taking centrestage were cross-voting Congress and SP MLAs, listening to what they called their \u201cantaratma ki awaz (inner voice)\u201d, ending up in BJP victories beyond what its numbers foretold, and dramatic upsets for Congress and SP in Uttar Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh. And, in the immediate aftermath, a suspenseful battle of survival for the sole Congress government in the north complete with allegations that six of its MLAs were spirited away to a resort in BJP-ruled Haryana (they have subsequently returned). At election\u2019s end, the BJP has pushed its way to within touching distance of a majority in the Upper House, while Congress looks even more disheveled, if that were possible, than it did before it. Going ahead, however, for both the losers and winner of Tuesday\u2019s tawdry contest, there are uncomfortable questions and, as the Lok Sabha election draws closer, much to reflect on. Congress had wrested Himachal Pradesh from theBJPin 2022 in an outright victory \u2013 it finished with 40 seats in a House of 68, with the BJP trailing well behind at 25. And yet, if Congress\u2019sSukhvinder Singh Sukhugovernment looks like it is teetering on the brink the day after a tie-breaker was needed for the lone RS seat in the state, a predatory BJP is primarily to blame \u2014 but Congress is also an accomplice in its own diminishing. By all accounts, the Congress high command turned a tin ear to the threats within \u2013 the chief ministership of Sukhu remained an unsettled matter and the party\u2019s attempted balancing act between rival factions was not succeeding in stanching the internal bloodletting. Just as Congress took its eye off the ball in Himachal Pradesh, the SP appeared to have lost its connect with its own leaders in UP. There have been indications for some time now that whileAkhilesh Yadavinherited the party from his father, he is a distant presence, displaying very little of Netaji\u2019s mulayam (soft) touch and constant engagement with party colleagues. For those who are restless or discontented in rival parties, the BJP\u2019s air of winnability, real and projected, is arguably a strong draw ahead of a crucial Lok Sabha election. And yet, that is surely not all there is to the phenomenon that seems to be picking up pace in state after state \u2013 of leaders and legislators from non-BJP parties crossing over to the BJP. Operation Lotus is no figment of the Opposition\u2019s imagination. Apart from MLAs floor-crossing and cross-voting in the BJP\u2019s favour, it folds in splits in rival parties, and the sudden demise of governments headed by non-BJP parties. It includes the BJP using fear and favour, carrot and stick, and the weaponisation of central agencies to selectively target those in Opposition parties. For now, its will to win at all costs may be delivering results. But as the party that rules at the Centre and in many states, and one that is likely to remain a dominant pole in the polity for the foreseeable future, the BJP must pause and reflect on the ramifications of its winner-takes-all approach even if it means playing fast and loose with the rules of the game. Smash-and-grab politics may yield an immediate dividend but it has a high cost. Vaqeel Hasan, leader of a team of miners who rescued 41 workers in Uttarakhand, returned home to find it demolished in an anti-encroachment drive. Despite pleading, his house was the only one targeted. Hasan, a father of three, emphasizes the need for unity after their heroic mission.

{"source": "Indian Express", "headline": "Express View on Gaganyaan: Sky\u2019s not the limit", "content": "Preparing to join their names in history books with Rakesh Sharma, the air force captain who became the first Indian in space in 1984, are Group Captain Prasanth Balakrishnan Nair, Group Captain Ajit Krishnan, Group Captain Angad Pratap, and Wing Commander Shubhanshu Shukla \u2014 the astronaut-designates for India\u2019s first human space flight mission, Gaganyaan. Having trained in anonymity for the last four years, they received their \u201castronaut wings\u201d on February 27 at the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre in Thumba, Kerala, from Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who described them as \u201cthe four forces\u201d representing the dreams of 1.4 billion Indians. What may have seemed like a dream almost too big, has acquired a human dimension. Announced in 2018, Gaganyaan is one of India\u2019s most ambitious space programmes. The task of sending humans into the vast unknown and bringing them back safely is more expensive and challenging than the Mars and Moon missions. A successful execution would put India in the company of the US, Russia and China. As stated on theISROwebsite, the short-term goal is to demonstrate human spaceflight to Low Earth Orbit, while the long-term goal is to lay the foundation for a \u201csustained Indian human space exploration programme\u201d. Success in its ultimate objective \u2014 proving that India is capable of indigenously developing this complex technology \u2014 would be a huge boost for ISRO. The excitement around Gaganyaan is not only a sign of how much ISRO\u2019s public profile has grown over the last few years, but also the increasing reach and scale of its ambitions. The success of recent missions like Mangalyaan andChandrayaan, while exhilarating in themselves, can become the start of something larger. The demonstrations of technological capabilities must be built on, if India wishes to eventually operate in the same league as the US or China. This can only happen if these successes help move towards an ecosystem that is able to compete with the most advanced. Opening up of the sector to private parties and allowing 100 per cent foreign direct investment are steps in the right direction. Indeed, a similar ambitious thrust is needed across sectors of scientific research. On several indicators, such as the share of GDP spent on research and development, nurturing universities to be centres for R&D and number of patents filed, India lags woefully. If putting Indians in space using made-in-India technology will be a dream come true, making Indian science and technology competitive at the highest level will mean the realisation of many more. Vaqeel Hasan, leader of a team of miners who rescued 41 workers in Uttarakhand, returned home to find it demolished in an anti-encroachment drive. Despite pleading, his house was the only one targeted. Hasan, a father of three, emphasizes the need for unity after their heroic mission.

"Express View: AI beauty revives old anxieties", "content": "One would imagine that the old stereotypes of fair and lovely, six-pack abs and chiselled jaw would have been retired by now. But if there weren\u2019t enough anxieties to plague women and men about the way they look already, there is now pressure from another corner \u2014 AI-generated reinforcement of outdated Western beauty norms. The sophistication of this articulation and its consequences are particularly hard on the young and the impressionable. The idea of being outliers on a beauty index that is limited in scope to begin with, deepens feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt. In the US, over 12,000 parents have launched an online petition to TikTok and YouTube, voicing concerns over AI-generated influencers who promote body dysmorphia among children and teenagers. But the problem is pervasive across countries and cultures. When Andrew Morton\u2019s Diana: A True Story came out in 1992, one of the most hard-hitting revelations was the British royal\u2019s struggle with bulimia. It opened up a conversation, quite possibly for the first time, on unrealistic beauty standards and the pressure of always looking well put together, no matter the state of one\u2019s mental health or well-being. In the decades since, celebrities from Kate Winslet toSonam Kapoorhave spoken up about the toll that keeping up appearances takes and about the hours of make-up and the airbrushing of images. In recognition of the damage it causes, Winslet introduced a no-Photoshop clause in her contract for commercials, taking ownership of her age and her wrinkles. The AI challenge to beauty norms requires a similar pushback, including the framing of a regulatory framework that makes it mandatory for users to declare its use in promotional enterprises. It also requires open conversations around why there is no one metric of beauty. As with most things in life, here, too, diversity is key. Vaqeel Hasan, leader of a team of miners who rescued 41 workers in Uttarakhand, returned home to find it demolished in an anti-encroachment drive. Despite pleading, his house was the only one targeted. Hasan, a father of three, emphasizes the need for unity after their heroic mission.

If nutrition experts like Neha Parihar and Sushma PS are to go by, a few handy measures can help make a difference to yourgutin a matter of a fortnight. Sushma, chief dietitian, Jindal Naturecure Institute mentioned that incorporating some practical tips can promote a diverse and thriving microbiome, leading to better digestion and overallgut function. Parihar took to Instagram to share what can help. \u2013 Diversifying your diet daily helps thegutas different foods support different types of bacteria. A diverse range of foods helps maintain a diverse microbiome, said Parihar. \u2013 Eating slowly, chewing well, and savouring your food can improve digestion. \u201cEating slowly, chewing thoroughly, and savoring your food can enhance the digestive process.

Polyphenols are found in several foods, herbs, and spices. \u2013 Our gut flora thrive on it.Fibresupports the growth of beneficial bacteria in the gut. Eat a diet relatively high in fibre-rich foods, such as fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains, said Parihar. \u201cOpt for a diet high in fibre-rich foods like fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains. Fibre supports the growth of beneficial bacteria, promoting a balanced and flourishing gut microbiome,\u201d said Sushma. \u2013 Added sugar is like rocket fuel for your microbiome. \u201cThat sounds like a good thing, but unfortunately it appears to encourage specific families of bacteria to \u2018take over\u2019, crowd others out and tip abalanced gutinto dysbiosis,\u201d said Parihar.   A post shared by Neha Parihar (@growithneha) \u2013 It seems strange that we can help our gut flora by not eating and starving them. Changes in the microbiome due to fasting are associated with increases in gut mucous. According to Sushma, fasting triggers positive changes in the microbiome, including increased production of gut mucus, which is beneficial for overallgut function. By following these simple yet impactful tweaks to your daily routine, you can kickstart the journey to a healthier gut in just 14 days, Sushma said, \u201cRemember, a diverse and well-nourished microbiome is key to supporting digestion,nutrient absorption, and overall gut function. Make these adjustments, and you\u2019ll be on your way to enjoying a happier and healthier gut,\u201d said Sushma.

Here are some exercises to keep you feeling your best", "content": "Hitting your 30s is often seen as a turning point, and that includes your physical health. While you might not notice significant changes overnight, your body\u2019s metabolism, hormone levels, and overall fitness can start to shift subtly. But fear not! Exercise can be your secret weapon for staying strong, healthy, and feeling your best in your 30s and beyond. Rahul Tarfe, a personal trainer and national-level bodybuilder, explained that for men, entering their 30s often means declining testosterone levels. \u201cThis can lead to muscle loss and decreased bone density.Exerciseacts as a superhero here, boosting testosterone, improving bone density, and even acting as an anti-ageing tool,\u201d he toldindianexpress.comin an interaction. For women, menopause brings about a reduction in estrogen levels, impacting bone density and increasing the risk of certain cancers. Exercise is your knight in shining armour, helping to boost metabolism, improve bone density, and keep you feeling youthful and energised, noted Tarfe. Whether you\u2019re a man or woman, incorporatinga well-rounded exercise routineis key. Here\u2019s what Rahul recommended: 1.Cardio: Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate or 300 minutes of vigorous cardio activity per week. This could involve brisk walking, running, swimming, dancing, or any activity that gets your heart rate up and keeps you moving for 30 minutes at least 2-3 times a week. 2. Strength Training:Dedicate 3-4 days a week to strength training for 45-60 minutes each session. This helps build and maintain muscle mass, improves bone density, and supports overall strength and function. Exercises like squats, lunges, push-ups, rows, and weightlifting exercises are great options. 3. Flexibility:Don\u2019t forget to cool down! Stretching for 10 minutes aftereach workoutimproves flexibility, reduces muscle soreness, and helps prevent injuries. Consistency is key! Sticking to a regular exercise routine, even if it\u2019s just 30 minutes a few times a week, will have a significant impact on your health and well-being. Consult a doctor or certified trainer for personalised guidance and ensure you\u2019re using proper form to avoid injury. Bonus Tip: Listen to your body. Some days, you might need a rest or a less intense workout. Be flexible and adjust your routine accordingly.

"headline": "Networking like a pro: Here\u2019s how industry leaders built their networks", "content": "Have you ever used a reference toget a new job? or attended a conference to gain new insights? or just sought career advice on social media? If you answered affirmatively to any of the above, you\u2019ve actively engaged in professional networking \u2014 the importance of which in today\u2019s world cannot be overstated. Nevertheless, embarking on the journey of building aprofessional networkcan appear daunting, with questions like \u201cWhere should I start?\u201d, \u201cHow can I leverage this network to advance my career?\u201d and \u201cWhat are the dos and don\u2019ts?\u201d surfacing. To shed light on these inquiries, we\u2019ve reached out to industry leaders and experts across various sectors. Building a strong professional network is crucial for both personal and career growth, said Anshul Agrawal, director, Mysore Deep Perfumery House & ZedBlack. This is regardless of whether you\u2019re employed, running a business or navigating student life. \u201cThe saying \u2018your network is your net worth\u2019 holds true,\u201d he added. Sharing his own experience, Agrawal said during his timestudying at IIT, his networking efforts helped him secure a job opportunity in 2007. \u201cHaving formed close connections with seniors who had interned at the organisation, I gained valuable insights into the company. Using this information, I successfully applied and was selected for the position.\u201d This sentiment resonates widely. In fact, according to a 2017LinkedInsurvey, 80 per cent of professionals consider professional networking important forcareer success, with 70 percent of them stating that they were hired in a company where they had a connection. Similarly, Meenu Anand, a leading HR professional, cultivated a strong network to gain deep insights and establish a strong foothold in her sector. As someone who struggled to keep updated with the emerging trends and best practices in human resources, networking allowed her to stay ahead of the curve. \u201cWith the help of meetings, events and social media platforms, I have been able to gain access to recent market trends, fresh perspectives, new ideas and gain visibility within the sector,\u201d she said. Not only this. Entrepreneurs, too, have a lot to benefit from professional networking, such as Manish Bansal, director and CEO of Window Magic, who attributes the success of his brand to his network. \u201cAs a businessman, building a professional network helped broaden my circle of influence among a larger section of society, and enhanced the trust and credibility of my brand. Opportunities for panel discussions and speaker engagements also arose through networking that made me forge stronger ties with other professionals and industries, which have all aided in maintaining the imagery and salience the brand enjoys.\u201d This holds true. Research published by theEconomist Intelligence Unitin 2016 found that networking is responsible for the success of 78 per cent of startups. According to the study, entrepreneurs who participated in a greater number of networking activities were more likely to experience positive outcomes such as increased profitability, revenue growth, innovation, capitalisation and talent acquisition. The first step, as per Ambreen Virk, CHRO, MyTrident, is to have clear goals. \u201cWhether it\u2019s finding a job, seeking mentorship, gaining industry insights or expanding your client base, having set priorities will ensure your networking effects are aligned to the outcome,\u201d she advised. Virk also recommends building a network \u201cas early as possible\u201d. \u201cWhile it is never too late to start, building a network while you\u2019re still in college can help achieve yourcareer goals.\u201d Next is to identify the right platform for networking, from social media to offline interactions. \u201cFinding communities where like-minded individuals converge is essential. While LinkedIn is an effective networking platform, platforms such as Toastmasters International, Entrepreneurs Organization, YPO (Young Professionals Organization), Lions Club, and Rotary Club offer unique networking opportunities,\u201d Agrawal said, adding that \u201cit\u2019s not just about joining, but actively participating and getting involved.\u201d Agrawal emphasises the importance of quality over quantity. \u201cHave you heard the phrase: \u2018you become the average of the five people you spend the most time with\u2019? Well, aligning yourself with individuals who share common goals is crucial for personal and professional development.\u201d However, building a professional network is an ongoing process, said Prachi Kaushik, founder and director, Vyomini. \u201cProfessional networking requires constant effort, patience, and the zeal to grow. Connecting once is not enough. Keeping in touch, following up and conversing beyond the limits of requirement builds a relationship based on trust, shared ideas and understanding. So, be consistent and real with the people you wish to build your professional networks with.\u201d Additionally, giving back to your network is equally important, said Rajesh Bharatiya, CEO, Peoplefy. \u201cAs you progress in your career, don\u2019t forget to pay it forward by helping others in your network. You can do this byoffering mentorshipto juniors, making introductions between connections, sharing job opportunities or resources, whenever possible. By helping and supporting others in your network without expecting immediate returns, you are practicing good karma and cultivating positive relationships that\u2019ll create future opportunities for advancement and success in your career. Sheenu Arora, director of human resources, Eros Hotel, Nehru Place, NewDelhi, shared the following to help you navigate the world of networking effectively: Dos: 1.Attend networking events:Actively participate in networking events and sessions to expand your network. Exchange business cards for sharing contacts and follow up with personalised messages or email communication. 2. Offer support: Networking is a two-way street. Be willing to offer support as and when needed. Share your expertise or learnings with others in your network if it helps strengthen connections. 3.Stay consistent:Engage regularly with network professionals on platforms like LinkedIn to stay connected. Be part of relevant groups and participate in discussions to gain visibility and build relationships. 4.Follow up:Don\u2019t hesitate to follow up after initial interactions. Sometimes, if you haven\u2019t heard back, a polite follow-up can reignite the conversation and lead to further opportunities. 5.Listen intently:Networking is not just about speaking and presenting yourself. Take the time to listen to others and be open to hearing their interests and insights. Authentic connections are built on mutual understanding and respect. Don\u2019ts: 1.Be discouraged by rejection:Not every networking interaction will lead to immediate success. Don\u2019t be discouraged by rejection and keep pursuing opportunities. The right connections will come in time. 2. Oversell yourself: While it\u2019s important to highlight your skills and experiences, avoid overselling yourself. Focus on adding value to your connections and building mutually beneficial relationships. 3.Approach networking selfishly:Don\u2019t approach networking solely as a means to gain something for yourself. Instead, focus on building genuine relationships based on mutual respect and shared interests. In essence, Bansal noted that nurturing a professional network is like raising a child. \u201cYou must devote time, effort, give it care and qualitative attention, and above all keep adding value to the network \u2014 just like you would do to your child \u2014 to help the network grow and flourish.\u201d Workplace Wellbeing is a weekly series about the ins and outs of our work lives.

Know all about the treatment", "content": "In vitro fertilization (IVF) offers a beacon of hope for couples struggling to conceive. But when is the ideal time to embark on this journey to maximise the chances of success? We explore the world ofIVF, examining factors influencing successful outcomes and the age at which women are most likely to experience positive results. Dr Jyoti Tripathi, a fertility consultant at Nova IVF Fertility, defines IVF as: \u201cA reproductive technology used to help individuals and couples conceive a child when natural conception is not possible or successful.\u201d While age plays a significant role, it\u2019s important to remember that individual circumstances vary. However, studies suggest that women under 35 generally havethe highest success rates for IVF. It\u2019s crucial to consult with a qualified fertility specialist for personalised guidance and to understand that statistics are not guarantees, experts urge. Dr Rupali Tambe, a fertility consultant at Nova IVFPune, highlights the legal age limit in India: \u201cAs per the ART law, the age limit for women is 50 years and 55 years for men in India.\u201d However, she emphasised that \u201csuccess rates tend to decline with advancing maternal age.\u201d While IVF is possible at an older age, it\u2019s essential to be aware of potential challenges: Dr. Tambe emphasised the importance of: IVF can be a life-changing option for individuals and couples facing fertility challenges. By understanding the factors influencing success rates, including age, and engaging in open communication with a fertility specialist, individuals can make informed decisions about their unique circumstances and navigate the IVF journey with realistic expectations and optimal preparation.

Consider the following statements: Statement 1: When a stream of light passes through a liquid, a fraction of the light scattered by the liquid is of a different colour. Statement 2: It is due to the change in the wavelength of light that occurs when a light beam is deflected by molecules. Which one of the following is correct in respect of the above statements? (a) Both Statement 1 and Statement 2 are correct and Statement 2 is the correct explanation for Statement 1. (b) Both Statement 1 and Statement 2 are correct and Statement 2 is not the correct explanation for Statement 1. (c) Statement 1 is correct but Statement 2 is incorrect. (d) Statement 1 is incorrect but Statement 2 is correct. With reference to Genie, consider the following statements: 1. It is a foundation world model that is trained on videos sourced from the Internet. 2. It can generate an endless variety of playable (action-controllable) worlds from synthetic images and photographs. Which of the statement(s) given above is/are correct? (a) 1 only (b) 2 only (c) Both 1 and 2 (d) Neither 1 nor 2 Which of the following U.S. spacecraft completed a seven-day journey to lunar orbit and softly landed near crater Malapert A in the South Pole region of the Moon? (a) Odysseus (b) Luna 1 (c) Suryevor 3 (d) Artemis With reference to the Crumbs homolog or CRB1 gene, consider the following statements: 1. It is associated with inherited eye diseases. 2. This gene is the cause of 10 per cent of Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) cases. 3. It plays an important role in controlling the integrity of the lower gastrointestinal tract. How many of the statements given above are correct? (a) Only one (b) Only two (c) All three (d) None Consider the following statements about Qubits: 1. It can be either a 1 or 0. 2. It represents the information in the quantum form. 3. It is hard to build and require huge cryogenic refrigerators. How many of the statements given above are correct? (a) Only one (b) Only two (c) All three (d) None FYI: \u2014In 1986, the Government of India, under then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, designated February 28 as National Science Dayto commemorate the announcement of the discovery of the \u201cRaman Effect\u201d. \u2014\u00a0The Raman Effect refers to thephenomenon in which when a stream of light passes through a liquid, a fraction of the light scattered by the liquid is of a different colour. \u2014It happens due to the change in the wavelength of light that occurs when a light beam is deflected by molecules. \u2014\u00a0The Raman Effect is when the change in the energy of the light is affected by the vibrations of the molecule or material under observation, leading to a change in its wavelength. Therefore, option (a) is the correct answer. FYI: \u2014Google DeepMind has just introduced Genie, a new model that can generate interactive video games from just a text or image prompt. \u2014 According to the officialGoogleDeepMind blog post, Genie is a foundation world model that is trained on videos sourced from the Internet.Hence, statement 1 is correct. \u2014 The model can generate an endless variety of playable (action-controllable) worlds from synthetic images, photographs, and even sketches.Hence, statement 2 is correct. \u2014\u00a0According to the research article \u2018Genie: Generative Interactive Environments\u2019, Genie is the first generative interactive environment to be taught unsupervised from unlabeled internet movies. \u2014\u00a0Genie has 11B parameters and includes a spatiotemporal video tokenizer, an autoregressive dynamics model, and a simple and scalable latent action model. \u2014\u00a0These technological specifications allow Genie to act on a frame-by-frame basis in created settings without the need for training, labels, or other domain-specific requirements. Therefore, option (c) is the correct answer. FYI: \u2014Odysseus, the first U.S. spacecraft to land on the moon since 1972. \u2014Odysseuscompleted a seven-day journey to lunar orbit and softly landed near crater Malapert A in the South Pole region of the Moon. \u2014\u00a0In an online update, Texas-based Intuitive Machines stated that its Houston control centre maintained contact with the lander while it \u201cefficiently sent payload science data and imagery in furtherance of the company\u2019s mission objectives.\u201d \u2014\u00a0The spacecraft reached the lunar surface after an 11th-hour navigational glitch and white-knuckle descent that ended with Odysseus landing in a sideways or sharply tilted position that has impeded its communications and solar-charging capability. Therefore, option (a) is the correct answer. FYI: \u2014Loss of sight in some inherited eye diseases may be caused by gut bacteria and could potentially be treated using antimicrobials. \u2014\u00a0The human gut has trillions of bacteria and many of them play an important role in healthy digestion. \u2014 Crumbs homolog or CRB1 gene is also associated with inherited eye diseases, most commonly either Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) or retinitis pigmentosa (RP).Hence, statement 1 is correct. \u2014 This gene is the cause of 10 per cent of LCA cases and 7 per cent of RP cases worldwide.Hence, statement 2 is correct. \u2014 They used mouse models to discover that CRB1 plays an important role in controlling the integrity of the lower gastrointestinal tract.Hence, statement 3 is correct. Therefore, option (c) is the correct answer. FYI: \u2014International Business Machines (IBM) has designed a new quantum computing chip, \u201cEagle\u201d has 127 so-called \u201cqubits,\u201d which can represent information in quantum form.Hence, statement 2 is correct. \u2014 The classical computers work using \u201cbits\u201d that must be either a 1 or 0, but qubits can be both a 1 and a 0 simultaneously. Quantum computers are much faster than classical computers.Hence, statement 1 is not correct. \u2014 The qubits are exceedingly hard to build and require huge cryogenic refrigerators to operate correctly.Hence, statement 3 is correct. Therefore, option (b) is the correct answer.

The city of Dwarka, Lord Krishna's ancient abode, is considered a significant pilgrimage site and is believed to have been submerged under the sea after Krishna's death. Scholars have suggested different locations for the exact site of Dwarka, and excavations on land and underwater have revealed artefacts from different time periods, but the search for the submerged city continues.

It covers essential topics of static and dynamic parts of the UPSC Civil Services syllabus covered under various GS papers. This answer-writing practice is designed to help you as a value addition to your UPSC CSE Mains. Attempt today\u2019s answer writing on questions related to topics ofGS-2to check your progress. How areRajya SabhaMPs elected? Discuss how voting is done and votes are counted. What is Raisina Dialogue? Discuss the thematic pillars of the dialogue. Introduction \u2014 The introduction of the answer is essential and should be restricted to 3-5 lines. Remember, a one-liner is not a standard introduction. \u2014 It may consist of basic information by giving some definitions from the trusted source and authentic facts. Body \u2014 It is the central part of the answer and one should understand the demand of the question to provide rich content. \u2014 The answer must be preferably written as a mix of points and short paragraphs rather than using long paragraphs or just points. \u2014 Using facts from authentic government sources makes your answer more comprehensive. Analysis is important based on the demand of the question, but do not over analyse. \u2014 Underlining keywords gives you an edge over other candidates and enhances presentation of the answer. \u2014 Using flowcharts/tree-diagram in the answers saves much time and boosts your score. However, it should be used logically and only where it is required. Way forward/ conclusion \u2014 The ending of the answer should be on a positive note and it should have a forward-looking approach. However, if you feel that an important problem must be highlighted, you may add it in your conclusion. Try not to repeat any point from body or introduction. \u2014 You may use the findings of reports or surveys conducted at national and international levels, quotes etc. in your answers. Self Evaluation \u2014 It is the most important part of our Mains answer writing practice.UPSC Essentialswill provide some guiding points or ideas as a thought process that will help you to evaluate your answers. QUESTION 1:How are Rajya Sabha MPs elected? Discuss how voting is done and votes are counted. Introduction: \u2014 Rajya Sabha is a permanent House and cannot be dissolved. To ensure continuity, one-third of its members retire after every second year, under Article 83(1) of the Constitution, and \u201cbiennial elections\u201d are held to fill these vacancies. The term of a member is six years. \u2014 The President nominates 12 of the 245 members, while the other 233 are representatives of the states and union territories ofDelhiand Puducherry. By-elections are held to fill vacancies caused by resignation, death, or disqualification, and those elected serve the remainder of their predecessors\u2019 terms. \u2014 Under Article 80(3), the 12 nominated members should have special knowledge or practical experience in matters like literature, science, art etc. A nominated member may join a party within six months of taking a seat. Body: You may incorporate some of the following points in the body of your answer: How voting is done? \u2014 Rajya Sabha MPs are elected by MLAs through an indirect election. \u2014 Article 80(4) provides that members shall be elected by the elected members of state Assemblies through a system of proportional representation by means of a single transferable vote. \u2014 The Fourth Schedule to the Constitution provides for allocation of Rajya Sabha seats to the states and Union Territories, on the basis of the population of each state. How votes are counted? \u2014 The number of votes a candidate requires depends on the number of vacancies and the strength of the House. If there is only one vacancy, the required quota under the Election Commission\u2019s Conduct of Election Rules, 1961, is calculated by taking the number of votes polled, divided it by 2, and adding 1. For example, if 100 votes are polled in an Assembly, the Rajya Sabha candidate would need: 100/2 + 1 = 51 votes \u2014 If there is more than one vacancy, the equation is based on an assigned value of 100 for every first-preference vote. The values of the votes credited to all candidates are totalled. The total is divided by 1 more than the number of vacancies, and 1 is added to this quotient. For example, if 100 members of an Assembly vote for 3 Rajya Sabha vacancies, the required quota by any candidate would be (100 \u00d7 100)/(3 + 1) + 1 = 2501 \u2014 If for any seat, candidates fail to get the specified number, the second-preference votes will be taken into account, but with a lower value.

Preliminary Examination:Economic and Social Development-Sustainable Development, Poverty, Inclusion, Demographics, Social Sector Initiatives, etc. Mains Examination:General Studies III: Indian Economy and issues relating to planning, mobilization, of resources, growth, development and employment. Key Points to Ponder: \u2022 What\u2019s the ongoing story-MULTIPLE WINGS IN the government have started to red-flag the Centre\u2019s moves to progressively hike customs duties, especially the more recent offensive targeted at imports of Chinese components and inputs. A section within the government is in favour of a more nuanced approach in using tariffs as a diplomatic tool, failing which there is a possibility of the gains of India\u2019s manufacturing-focused thrust that include schemes such as Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) being squandered away. \u2022 Why Centre is progressively increasing customs duties? \u2022 What is customs duty? \u2022 Why India Inc wants lower duty? \u2022 Do You Know-China still accounts for 14 per cent of India\u2019s imports with not just inputs for the domestic industry in sectors ranging from electronics to pharmaceuticals and textiles to leather, but also capital goods, being sourced from China. This, coupled with the fact that average tariffs in India have jumped to 18.1 per cent in 2022 from 13 per cent eight years ago in 2014, has made India uncompetitive vis-a-vis countries such as Vietnam, Thailand and Mexico. India accounts for negligible share in China\u2019s total trade, but significantly depends on Chinese imports in key sectors including pharmaceuticals and electronics. Official data shows that India is home to barely 3 per cent of Chinese exports. But China is one of India\u2019s biggest import sources, making up for 14 per cent of India\u2019s total imports, especially with regard to intermediate goods and capital goods. This dependency has left India vulnerable to supply chain disruption. \u2022 Why India imposed Quality Control Orders (QCOs) on imports from China? \u2022 What are the government\u2019s policy options to reduce trade deficit? \u2022 How hikes in import duties will help Government to overcome trade deficit?

Key Points to Ponder: \u2022 What\u2019s the ongoing story-The Congress government in Karnataka is considering passage of its temple funds amendment Bill in the state Assembly for a second time after the Bill was defeated in the Legislative Council by the OppositionBJP-JDS combine Friday. \u2022 Karnataka Hindu Religious Institutions and Charitable Endowments (Amendment) Bill, 2024-Know the highlights \u2022 What is the rationale behind the Karnataka Hindu Religious Institutions and Charitable Endowments (Amendment) Bill, 2024? \u2022 What\u2019s the amendment in Karnataka Hindu Religious Institutions and Charitable Endowments (Amendment) Bill, 2024? \u2022 Karnataka Hindu Religious Institutions and Charitable Endowments Act, 1997 and Karnataka Hindu Religious Institutions and Charitable Endowments (Amendment) Bill, 2024-Compare and contrast \u2022 How has temple funding differed across govts? \u2022 For Your Information-There are around 35,000 temples under the Muzrai Department, of which 205 whose income exceeds Rs 25 lakh per year are categorised as Group A, 193 with incomes between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 25 lakh are Group B and around 34,000 temples with incomes below 5 lakh are Group C. Till date, Group A temples contributed 10 per cent of the revenue generated from collection boxes to a Central Fund and Group B contributed five per cent. There were no contributions from Group C temples. As per the amendment, temples with incomes above Rs 1 crore will have to contribute 10 per cent to the Common Pool Fund, and temples generating Rs 10 lakh to Rs 1 crore revenue should chip in five per cent to the fund. Temples with incomes below Rs 10 lakh will not have to contribute at all, according to the Muzrai minister. The funds will be under Rajya Dharmika Parishat and will be used to grant aid primarily to Category C temples apart from providing welfare measures to families of archaks and other employees at these temples, he said. The state high-level committee and district high-level committees were also formed to review and submit proposals for amenities at Group A temples. The amendment to the 1997 Act essentially intends to \u201cenhance the amount of common pool funds\u201d available to the government for the upkeep of nearly 35,000 temples in the state and for socio-religious work. The Bill intended to divert \u201c10% of the gross income of institutions whose gross annual income exceeds Rs 1 crore,\u201d to a common pool for the maintenance of temples instead of the existing \u201c10% of the net income of institutions whose gross annual income exceeds Rs 10 lakh\u201d. In addition, the Bill dedicates 5% of the income of institutions earning between Rs 10 lakh and Rs 1 crore to the common pool, changing the previous income bracket from Rs 5 lakh to Rs 10 lakh. Incidentally, the common pool of funds generated by the diversion of revenues of wealthy temples is the main source of funding for smaller temples in Karnataka, apart from grants from the state government. Introducing the amendment, Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (also known as Muzrai) Minister Ramalinga Reddy said the common fund will be used to provide various amenities to temples, insurance cover and death relief to priests, and scholarships to children of around 40,000 priests\u2019 families. There are 34,563 temples falling under the purview of the Karnataka government at present, under three separate categories. According to government data from 2022, 205 temples under the Muzrai department earn up to Rs 25 lakh or more per annum, 139 earn up to Rs 10 lakh, and 34,219 temples earn less than Rs 5 lakh per annum. A vast majority of the temples in Karnataka are thus heavily dependent on government grants for functioning. In fact, the previous BJP government had increased the tasdik allowance or land compensation paid per year to temples from Rs 48,000 to Rs 60,000 in 2022. This was after ending it for non-Hindu religious institutions, like mosques, due to protests by Hindu groups. The move came despite the fact that tasdik was a state grant, and had nothing to do with temple revenues. According to government data on grants to temples under the Muzrai department, between 2017 and 2022, the BJP when in power allocated the highest amount of funds for temples. While a BJP government allocated Rs 465 crore in 2020-21, the Congress grant was Rs 477 crore in 2017-18. In 2018-19, a Congress-Janata Dal(Secular) coalition government allocated Rs 248 crore, followed by the BJP government\u2019s allocation of Rs 294 crore in 2019-20. \u2022 What is the political significance of temple funding?

Main Examination:General Studies III: Infrastructure: Energy, Ports, Roads, Airports, Railways etc. Key Points to Ponder: \u2022 What\u2019s the ongoing story-Prime MinisterNarendra Modirecently inaugurated the Banihal-Sangaldan section of the railway line which aims to connect Baramulla in North Kashmir to Udhampur inJammu. He also flagged off Jammu and Kashmir\u2019s first electric train from Sangaldan to Srinagar and Baramulla. \u2022 Map Work-Banihal-Sangaldan railway line \u2022 Banihal-Sangaldan railway line-Know key highlights \u2022 Do You Know-More than 90 per cent of the 48-km railway line between Banihal to Sangaldan passes through tunnels in the mountainous Ramban district, including the country\u2019s longest 12.77-km tunnel (T-50). It also has 16 bridges. For the safety and rescue of passengers in emergencies, it has three escape tunnels with a combined length of 30.1 km. It has been built at a cost of Rs 15,863 crore. \u2022 Why it is important? \u2022 History of railways in Jammu and Kashmir-Know in detail \u2022 Railways in Jammu and Kashmir-why important? \u2022 Do You Know-The first railway line in the former princely state of Jammu and Kashmir was built by the British in 1897 over a distance of 40-45 km between Jammu and Sialkot in the plains. In 1902 and 1905, a railway line was proposed between Rawalpindi and Srinagar along the course of the Jhelum, which would have connected the Kashmir Valley with the railway network of undivided India. But Maharaja Pratap Singh of Jammu and Kashmir was in favour of a Jammu-Srinagar line via Reasi, and neither project progressed. After Partition, Sialkot went to Pakistan, and Jammu was disconnected from the rail network of India. Until the inauguration of the Pathankot-Jammu line in 1975, the railway station nearest to Jammu and Kashmir was Pathankot in Punjab.In 1983, work began on a railway line between Jammu and Udhampur. The 53-km line, estimated to cost Rs 50 crore, was supposed to be completed in five years, but ultimately took 21 years and Rs 515 crore. The project, which was completed in 2004, has 20 major tunnels, the longest of which is 2.5 km long, and 158 bridges, the highest of which is 77 m high. With work underway on the Jammu-Udhampur line, the Centre in 1994 announced the extension of the line from Udhampur to Srinagar, and then Baramulla. This was the Udhampur-Srinagar-Baramulla Railwayline (USBRL) project, which was approved in March 1995 at an estimated cost of Rs 2,500 crore. The project got momentum after 2002, when Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee declared it a national project on account of its being among the most challenging works undertaken by the Indian Railways after Independence. The project cost has now ballooned to more than Rs 35,000 crore. The line will connect Srinagar and Baramulla in the Valley with the rest of the country by train, and will provide a reliable and cost-effective all-weather alternative to the Jammu-Srinagar national highway that is frequently shut down due to landslides \u2022 Railways in Jammu and Kashmir-what are the challenges and innovations?

Main Examination:General Studies II: Issues relating to development and management of Social Sector/Services relating to Health, Education, Human Resources. Key Points to Ponder: \u2022 What\u2019s the ongoing story-A key aspect of The Right Of Children To Free And Compulsory Education Act, 2009 (RTE Act) is the obligation placed on private schools to ensure that 25 per cent of Class 1 students admitted must belong to \u201cweaker section and disadvantaged group in the neighbourhood\u201d. Students admitted under this quota are given fee concessions, with the state government meant to reimburse private schools for the same. \u2022 What exactly does the new rule state? \u2022 Why have states introduced such exemptions? \u2022 For Your Information-The new rule states that the \u201clocal authority shall not identify the private unaided school, for the purposes of 25 per cent admission of disadvantaged group and weaker section under the Maharashtra Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Rules, 2013, where government schools and aided schools are situated within one-kilometre radius of that school.\u201d This means that private schools within a 1 km radius of a government or government-aided school (which receives money from the government) will no longer have to observe the 25% requirement. Instead, students in these neighbourhoods will be considered for admission into said government or aided schools first. This exemption would also apply to private schools established in the future, as long as they are built within a 1 km radius of a government or aided school. In case there are no government or aided schools in the vicinity, the notification states that private schools will be identified for RTE admissions. With this new rule, Maharashtra has joined Karnataka and Kerala as states that have imposed this new regime to exempt private schools from providing RTE admissions. Karnataka introduced the rule in December 2018, and specifically referenced the Kerala rules which were introduced in 2011. In Kerala, the fee concession for students is only made available to RTE quota students if there are no government or aided schools \u201cwithin walking distance\u201d, which is 1 km for students joining in Class 1. In Karnataka, when the rule was introduced in 2018, the state law minister Krishna Byregowda said: \u201cThe primary intention of RTE is to provide education to all classes of students\u2026 Till date, Karnataka had allowed parents to admit children in private schools despite having government schools in the same neighbourhood. This has resulted in the enrollment ratio [in government schools] dropping drastically.\u201d Private schools and teachers\u2019 organisations have also highlighted that state governments have also often failed to reimburse the fees for students admitted through this quota. According to Section 12(2) of the RTE Act, state governments are bound to reimburse expenses incurred by the school per-child, or the fee amount, whichever is less. In Maharashtra, the Maharashtra English School Trustees Association (MESTA) threatened to boycott RTE admissions last December citing pending payments of Rs. 1800 crore in reimbursements. \u2022 How has the new rule been received?

The cellar is called \u2018Vyasji ka tehkhana\u2019, after the Vyas family who claim to own the property.

This is mentioned in the 1937 book, \u2018History of Benares: From the Earliest Times Down to 1937\u2019, by A S Altekar, who was head of the Department of Ancient Indian History and Culture at Banaras Hindu University. The plinth of the temple was left untouched, and served as the courtyard of the mosque. One of the walls too was spared, and it became the qibla wall, the most important wall in a mosque that faces Mecca. Material from the destroyed temple was used to build the mosque, evidence of which can be seen today. The name of the mosque is said to have derived from an adjoining well, the Gyanvapi, or Well of Knowledge. An old sculpture of the Nandi bull inside the compound of the present Kashi Vishwanath Temple faces the wall of the mosque instead of the sanctum sanctorum of the temple. It is believed that Nandi is in fact, facing the sanctum sanctorum of the original Vishweshwar temple.For more than 100 years after the mosque was built, there was no temple at the site. The present Kashi Vishwanath Temple was built in the 18th century by Rani Ahilyabai Holkar of Indore, immediately to the south of the mosque. Over the decades it emerged as one of the most prominent and revered centres of the Hindu religion. Many Hindus have long believed that the original lingam of the erstwhile Vishweshwar temple was hidden by the priests inside the Gyanvapi well during Aurangzeb\u2019s raid \u2014 which has fired the desire to conduct puja and rituals at the sacred place where the mosque now stands. From time to time, petitioners have laid claim to the mosque, saying it remains the original sacred place of Hindu worship. The VHP\u2019s Ram Temple movement aimed to \u201cliberate\u201d, apart from the Ramjanmabhoomi Temple-Babri Masjid site in Ayodhya, the Kashi-Vishwanath Temple-Gyanvapi mosque site and the Shri Krishna Janmabhoomi in Mathura as well.The Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991 \u2014 which mandates that the nature of all places of worship, except the one in Ayodhya that was then under litigation, shall be maintained as it was on August 15, 1947, and that no encroachment of any such place prior to the date can be challenged in courts \u2014 applies to the disputed complex in Varanasi. In April 2021, Fast Track Court Civil Judge (Senior Division) Ashutosh Tiwari ordered the Director General of the Archaeological Survey of India to \u201cget a comprehensive archaeological physical survey\u201d done of the Kashi Vishwanath Temple-Gyanvapi Mosque complex to \u201cfind out as to whether the religious structure standing at present at the disputed site is a superimposition, alteration or addition or there is a structural overlapping of any kind, with or over, any religious structure\u201d. The mosque is not an ASI-protected site, and the ASI has no role in its maintenance or upkeep. The site is currently opened for Hindu prayers once a year \u2014 on the fourth day of the chaitra navratri in April. The petitioners have also sought permission to pray to other \u201cvisible and invisible deities within the old temple complex\u201d. \u2022 What is thePlaces of Worship (Special Provisions) Act 1991? \u2022 Under what circumstances was the Places of Worship Act, 1991 law enacted, and how did the government justify it? \u2022 How Judiciary has interpreted the Places of Worship Act, 1991? \u2022 The Places of Worship Act, 1991-Know the Key Provisions \u2022 What Section 3 of the Places of Worship Act, 1991 is all about? \u2022 Section 4(1) and Section 4(2) of the Places of worship act, 1991-Know the provisions \u2022 What is Kashi Vishwanath Temple Act, 1983? \u2022 The court cited Section 4 (9) of the Kashi Vishwanath Temple Act, 1983, defines \u201cTemple\u201d-What is Temple? \u2022 Is right to worship a fundamental right? \u2022 What is the meaning of freedom of worship? \u2022 Right to Freedom of Religion from Articles 25 to 28-Know in detail \u2022 Is litigation the best method to resolve disputes between faith-based communities?

Mains Examination:General Studies II: Bilateral, regional and global groupings and agreements involving India and/or affecting India\u2019s interests. Key Points to Ponder: \u2022 What\u2019s the ongoing story-Hungary\u2019s parliament approved Sweden\u2019sNATOaccession on Monday, clearing the last hurdle before the historic step by the Nordic country whose neutrality lasted through two world wars and the simmering conflict of the Cold War. \u2022 Why does Sweden want to join NATO? \u2022 What will Sweden bring to NATO? \u2022 North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)-Know the historical background and current Status \u2022 What is Article 5 of NATO\u2019s founding treaty (Collective Security)? \u2022 What is Article 4 of NATO\u2019s Founding Treaty? \u2022 North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)-Know the historical background and current Status \u2022 What are the origins of NATO? \u2022 How is NATO funded? \u2022 How many NATO members meet the defence spending target? \u2022 What is important about NATO\u2019s collective defence? \u2022Do You Know-Founded in 1949 to counter the Soviet Union with Cold War tensions rising, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is a political and military alliance of countries from North America and Europe. Enshrined in Article 5 of its founding treaty is the principle of collective defence \u2013 the idea that an attack on one member is considered an attack on all of them. NATO takes decisions by consensus but the political and military strength of the United States means that it is by far the most powerful country in the alliance, with its nuclear arsenal seen as the ultimate security guarantee. NATO currently has 31 members \u2013 most of them European nations, plus the United States and Canada. The newest member is Finland, which joined last April in reaction to Russia\u2019s 2022 invasion ofUkraine. Sweden applied to join along with Finland but is waiting for Hungary to ratify its application as the final major step before membership. During the Cold War, NATO\u2019s main focus was protecting Western Europe from the Soviet Union. After the 1989 fall of the Berlin Wall, NATO expanded to take in former communist bloc countries from Central and Eastern Europe. NATO\u2019s members range from large countries such as Britain, France, Germany and Turkey to small nations such as Iceland and Montenegro. According to NATO estimates from July last year, 11 members were expected to meet the 2% target in 2023. Those members were Poland, the United States, Greece, Estonia, Lithuania, Finland, Romania, Hungary, Latvia, Britain and Slovakia. Germany, Europe\u2019s economic heavyweight, was estimated at 1.57%. But German officials have said they expect to meet the 2% target this year, partly thanks to a special 100-billion-euro fund established in response to Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. The lowest spenders as a share of national GDP were Spain, Belgium and Luxembourg, according to the NATO figures.NATO is expected to release updated figures in the coming days that will show more allies meeting the 2% target, according to people familiar with the data. In Article 5 of the founding treaty, NATO members declared that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America \u201cshall be considered an attack against them all\u201d. They agreed they would \u201cassist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force\u201d. However, Article 5 stops short of a commitment to an automatic military response to help an ally under attack. That means the strength of Article 5 depends on clear statements from political leaders that it will be backed up by action. This is one reason Trump\u2019s comments caused such a furore, particularly as they came at a time of heightened alarm in NATO about Russia\u2019s intentions, following its invasion of Ukraine. By suggesting he would not take military action to defend an ally, Trump undermined the assumptions that give Article 5 its power. \u201cAny suggestion that allies will not defend each other undermines all of our security, including that of the U.S., and puts American and European soldiers at increased risk,\u201d NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Sunday. \u2022 Why India never joined North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)?

Therefore, option (b) is the correct answer. (Other Source:whc.unesco.org) FYI: \u2014 TheNehru-Liaquat Pactwas a bilateral agreement signed between India and Pakistan.Hence, statement 1 is correct. \u2014 The pact was signed in order to provide a framework for the treatment of minorities in the two countries.Hence, statement 3 is correct. \u2014 It is also known as the Delhi Pact.Hence, statement 2 is correct. \u2014 It was signed by the two country\u2019s prime ministers, Jawaharlal Nehru and Liaquat Ali Khan. Therefore, option (c) is the correct answer. FYI: \u2014Kambala is a folk sport practised in coastal Karnataka districts, especially in regions where Tulu speakers form a majority.Hence, statement 1 is correct. \u2014 Kambala is a matter of prestige for many families, especially from the Bunt community in the coastal areas. The races are hosted by various families and groups in muddy fields after paddy harvesting.Hence, statement 3 is correct. \u2014 Kambala is generally held under four categories: (1) Negilu (plough), where light ploughs are used to tie buffaloes for the race. The event is for entry-level animals.Hence, statement 2 is not correct. (2) Hagga (rope), where buffaloes are raced by jockeys with just a rope tying the pair together. (3) Adda Halage, in which jockeys stand over a horizontal plank dragged by buffaloes. Thus, unlike Hagga and Negilu, where jockeys run behind the animals, in this, buffaloes drag the jockeys. (4) Kane Halage, where a wooden plank is tied to buffaloes. The plank, on which the jockeys stand, has two holes through which water gushes out as the plank is dragged along the slush tracks. The height to which water splashes determines the winner of the event.Hence, statement 4 is correct. Therefore, option (c) is the correct answer. FYI: \u2014 \u201cChokuwa rice of Assam\u201d is a unique gift of nature. This class of rice is not known in any other parts of the world. \u2014 It is aspecial class of semi glutinous winter rice(Sali rice in vernacular) of Assam which is in cultivation from time immemorial. \u2014Assamhas received a Geographical Indication (GI) tag for Chokuwa Rice under Sub-section (1) of Section 13 of Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration and Protection) Act, 1999. \u2014 This group of rice is characterized bylow amylose content(12-17 per cent) of the grains. Therefore, option (d) is the correct answer. (Source:search.ipindia.gov.in) FYI: \u2014\u00a0In 1997,37,000 people of the Bru (or Reang) tribe fled toTripurafrom Mizoram, on account of ethnic clashes there.

In Mizoram, they were targeted by ethnic organisations who demanded that the Brus be excluded from electoral rolls. Therefore, option (a) is the correct answer.

"headline": "Joe Biden \u2018continues to be fit for duty,\u2019 his doctor says, after president undergoes annual physical", "content": "President Joe Biden \u201ccontinues to be fit for duty,\u201d his doctor wrote Wednesday after conducting an annual physical that is being closely watched as the 81-year-old seeks reelection in November. Dr. Kevin O\u2019Connor, Biden\u2019s physician, wrote that the president is adjusting well to a new device that helps control his sleep apnea and has experienced some hip discomfort but also works out five times per week. \u201cPresident Biden is a healthy, active, robust, 81-year-old male who remains fit to successfully execute the duties of the presidency,\u201d O\u2019Connor said in a six-page memo on the president\u2019s health, following a physical that took Biden to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for more than 2 1/2 hours. His memo added that Biden \u201cfeels well and this year\u2019s physical identifies no new concerns.\u201dThe oldest president in US history, Biden would be 86 by the end of a second term, should he win one. His latest physical mirrored one he had in February last year when O\u2019Connor described Biden as \u201chealthy, vigorous\u201d and \u201cfit\u201d to handle his White House duties. Still, voters are approaching this year\u2019s election with misgivings about Biden\u2019s age, having scrutinized his gaffes, his coughing, his slow walking and even a tumble off his bicycle. After he returned to the White House on Wednesday, Biden attended an event on combating crime and suggested that when it came to his health \u201ceverything is squared away\u201d and \u201cthere is nothing different than last year.\u201d He also joked about his age and people thinking \u201cI look too young.\u201d Former PresidentDonald Trump, 77, is the favorite to lock up the Republican nomination later this month, which would bring him closer to a November rematch against Biden. Trump was 70 when he took office in 2017, which made him the oldest American president to be inaugurated \u2014 until Biden broke his record by being inaugurated at 78 in 2021. O\u2019Connor\u2019s report said that Biden\u2019s stiff walking was no worse than last year and was the result of arthritic changes in his spine. He said the president also noted \u201csome increased left hip discomfort.\u201d There were no signs of stroke, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson\u2019s or other similar conditions in what the report called an \u201cextremely detailed neurologic exam.\u201d Biden, last summer, began using a continuous positive airway pressure, or CPAP, machine at night to help with sleep apnea, and O\u2019Connor wrote that the president had responded well to that treatment and is \u201cdiligently compliant\u201d about using it. A recent special counsel\u2019s report on the investigation into Biden\u2019s handling of classified documents repeatedly derided Biden\u2019s memory, calling it \u201chazy,\u201d \u201cfuzzy,\u201d \u201cfaulty,\u201d \u201cpoor\u201d and having \u201csignificant limitations.\u201d It also noted that Biden could not recall defining milestones in his own life such as when his son Beau died or when he served as vice president. Still, addressing reporters the evening of the report\u2019s release, Biden said \u201cmy memory is fine\u201d and grew visibly angry as he denied forgetting when his son died of braincancerin 2015 at the age of 46. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that O\u2019Connor was one of a team of 20 different medical specialists who helped complete the physical. Asked why Biden wasn\u2019t undergoing a cognitive test as part of the physical, Jean-Pierre said that O\u2019Connor and Biden\u2019s neurologist \u201cdon\u2019t believe he needs one.\u201d \u201cHe passes a cognitive test every day, every day as he moves from one topic to another topic, understanding the granular level of these topics,\u201d Jean-Pierre said, noting that Biden tackled such diverse issues as Wednesday\u2019s crime prevention event before his planned trip to the US-Mexico border on Thursday and next week\u2019sState of the Union address. \u201cThis is a very rigorous job,\u201d she added. That picture of the president doesn\u2019t reflect the type of struggles with routine tasks that might indicate the need for further tests, said Dr. Michael Rosenbloom, a neurologist at the University of Washington School of Medicine. \u201cConstantly questioning older folks who may have an occasional lapse is a form of ageism,\u201d Rosenbloom said.From sleep apnea to arthritis, Biden\u2019s health report \u201cseems pretty run of the mill for an 81-year-old person,\u201d said Dr. Jeffrey A. Linder, chief of general internal medicine at Northwestern University\u2019s Feinberg School of Medicine. \u201cHis doctors are in a unique position to assess his cognitive ability on a daily basis,\u201d Linder said. \u201cThese doctors are able to see how he\u2019s functioning day to day. That\u2019s much more useful\u201d than a cognitive assessment. Many Americans, including Democrats, have expressed reservations about Biden seeking a second term during this fall\u2019s election. Only 37% of Democrats say Biden should pursue reelection, down from 52% before the 2022 midterm elections, according to a poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Biden counters that his age brings wisdom, and he has begun to criticize Trump for the former president\u2019s recent public gaffes. The president joked that his age was classified information and suggested during a taping in New York on Monday of \u201cLate Night With Seth Meyers ? that Trump mistakenly called his wife Melania, \u201cMercedes\u201d during a weekend speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference \u2014 though the Trump campaign says he was correctly referring to political commentator Mercedes Schlapp. Trump has indeed had his share of verbal miscues, mixing up the city and state where he was campaigning, calling Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n the leader of Turkey and repeatedly mispronouncing the militant group Hamas as \u201chummus.\u201d More recently, he confused his Republican primary rivalNikki Haleywith former Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.While he was president, Trump\u2019s annual physical in 2019 revealed that he had gained weight and was up to 243 pounds. With his 6-foot, 3-inch frame, that meant Trump\u2019s Body Mass Index was 30.4. An index rating of 30 is the level at which doctors consider someone obese under this commonly used formula. Wednesday\u2019s report listed Biden as 6-foot tall and weighing 178 pounds. Weeks before the general elections, IE 100, the list of the 100 most powerful Indians this year, maps the lay of the land \u2014 the BJP holding strong, the Opposition trying to hold it together.

"Execution of US serial killer halted after 8 attempts to insert IV line for lethal injection failed", "content": "Idaho halted the execution of serial killer Thomas Eugene Creech on Wednesday after medical team members repeatedly failed to find a vein where they could establish an intravenous line to carry out the lethal injection. Creech, 73, has been in prison half a century, convicted of five murders in three states and suspected of several more. He was already serving a life term when he beat a fellow inmate, 22-year-old David Dale Jensen, to death in 1981 \u2014 the crime for which he was to be executed. Creech, one of the longest-serving death row inmates in the US, was wheeled into the execution chamber at the Idaho Maximum Security Institution on a gurney at 10 am.\u00a0Three medical team members tried eight times to establish an IV, Department of Correction Director Josh Tewalt told a news conference afterward. In some cases, they couldn\u2019t access the vein, and in others they could but had concerns about vein quality. They attempted sites in his arms, legs, hands and feet. At one point, a medical team member left to gather more supplies. The warden announced he was halting the execution at 10.58 am. The corrections department said its death warrant for Creech would expire, and that it was considering next steps. While other medical procedures might allow for the execution, the state is mindful of the 8th Amendment\u2019s ban on cruel and unusual punishment, Tewalt said. Creech\u2019s attorneys immediately filed a new motion for a stay in US District Court, saying \u201cthe badly botched execution attempt\u201d proves the department\u2019s \u201cinability to carry out a humane and constitutional execution.\u201d The court granted the stay after Idaho confirmed it would not try again to execute him before the death warrant expired; the state will have to obtain another warrant if it wants to carry out the execution. \u201cThis is what happens when unknown individuals with unknown training are assigned to carry out an execution,\u201d the Federal Defender Services of Idaho said in a written statement. \u201cThis is precisely the kind of mishap we warned the State and the Courts could happen when attempting to execute one of the country\u2019s oldest death-row inmates.\u201d Six Idaho officials, including Attorney General Raul Labrador, and four news media representatives, including anAssociated Pressreporter, were on hand to witness the attempt \u2014 which was to be Idaho\u2019s first execution in 12 years. The execution team was made up entirely of volunteers, the corrections department said. Those tasked with inserting the IVs and administering the lethal drug had medical training, but their identities were kept secret. They wore white balaclava-style face coverings and navy scrub caps to conceal their faces. With each attempt to insert an IV, the medical team cleaned the skin with alcohol, injected a numbing solution, cleaned the skin again and then attempted to place the IV catheter. Each attempt took several minutes, with medical team members palpating the skin and trying to position the needles. Creech frequently looked toward his family members and representatives, who were sitting in a separate witness room. His arms were strapped to the table, but he often extended his fingers toward them. He appeared to mouth \u201cI love you\u201d to someone in the room on occasion. After the execution was halted, the warden approached Creech and whispered to him for several minutes, giving his arm a squeeze. A few hours afterward, Labrador released a statement saying that \u201cjustice had been delayed again.\u201d \u201cOur duty is to seek justice for the many victims and their families who experienced the brutality and senselessness of his actions,\u201d the attorney general wrote. Creech\u2019s attorneys filed a flurry of late appeals hoping to forestall his execution. They included claims that his clemency hearing was unfair, that it was unconstitutional to kill him because he was sentenced by a judge rather than a jury \u2014 and that the state had not provided enough information about how it obtained the lethal drug, pentobarbital, or how it was to be administered. But the courts found no grounds for leniency. Creech\u2019s last chance \u2014 a petition to the US Supreme Court \u2014 was denied a few hours before the scheduled execution Wednesday. On Tuesday night, Creech spent time with his wife and ate a last meal including fried chicken, mashed potatoes, gravy and ice cream. A group of about 15 protesters gathered outside the prison Wednesday, at one point singing \u201cAmazing Grace.\u201d An Ohio native, Creech has spent most of his life behind bars in Idaho. He was acquitted of a killing in Tucson, Arizona, in 1973 \u2014 authorities nevertheless believe he did it, as he used the victim\u2019s credit card to travel to Oregon. He was later convicted of a 1974 killing in Oregon and one in California, where he traveled after earning a weekend pass from a psychiatric hospital. Later that year, Creech was arrested in Idaho after killing John Wayne Bradford and Edward Thomas Arnold, two house painters who had picked him and his girlfriend up while they were hitchhiking. He was serving a life sentence for those murders in 1981 when he beat Jensen to death. Jensen was disabled and serving time for car theft. Jensen\u2019s family members described him during Creech\u2019s clemency hearing last month as a gentle soul who loved hunting and being outdoors. Jensen\u2019s daughter was 4 years old when he died, and she spoke about how painful it was to grow up without a father. Creech\u2019s supporters say he is a deeply changed man. Several years ago he married the mother of a correctional officer, and former prison staffers said he was known for writing poetry and expressing gratitude for their work. During his clemency hearing, Ada County Deputy Prosecuting Attorney Jill Longhorst did not dispute that Creech can be charming. But she said he is nevertheless a psychopath \u2014 lacking remorse and empathy. Last year, Idaho lawmakers passed a law authorising execution by firing squad when lethal injection is not available. Prison officials have not yet written a standard operating policy for the use of firing squad, nor have they constructed a facility where a firing squad execution could occur. Both would have to happen before the state could attempt to use the new law, which would likely trigger several legal challenges.Other states have also had trouble carrying out lethal injections. Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey paused executions for several months to conduct an internal review after officials called off the lethal injection of Kenneth Eugene Smith in November 2022 \u2014 the third time since 2018 Alabama had been unable to conduct executions due to problems with IV lines. Smith in January became the first person to be put to death using nitrogen gas. He shook and convulsed for several minutes on the death chamber gurney during the execution. Idaho does not allow execution by nitrogen hypoxia. In 2014, Oklahoma officials tried to halt a lethal injection when the prisoner, Clayton Lockett, began writhing after being declared unconscious. He died after 43 minutes; a review found his IV line came loose. Weeks before the general elections, IE 100, the list of the 100 most powerful Indians this year, maps the lay of the land \u2014 the BJP holding strong, the Opposition trying to hold it together.

immunity claim in 2020 election case", "content": "The US Supreme Court on Wednesday agreed to decide Donald Trump\u2019s claim of immunity from prosecution for trying to overturn his 2020 election loss, giving him a boost as he tries to delay criminal prosecutions while running to regain the presidency. The justices put on hold the criminal case being pursued by Special Counsel Jack Smith and will review a lower court\u2019s rejection of Trump\u2019s claim of immunity from prosecution because he was president when he took actions aimed at reversing PresidentJoe Biden\u2019s election victory over him. The Supreme Court set the case for oral argument during the week of April 22 on a single question: \u201cWhether and if so to what extent does a former president enjoy presidential immunity from criminal prosecution for conduct alleged to involve official acts during his tenure in office.\u201d Trump, the first former president to be criminally prosecuted, is the frontrunner for the Republican nomination tochallenge Biden,a Democrat, in the November 5 US election. The case once again thrusts the nation\u2019s top judicial body, whose 6-3 conservative majority includes three justices appointed by Trump, into the election fray. The Supreme Court also is due to issue a ruling on whether to overturn a judicial decision that barred Trump from Colorado\u2019s Republican primary ballot based on a constitutional provision regarding insurrection. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on Feb. 6 ruled 3-0 against Trump\u2019s immunity claim, rejecting his bid for \u201cunbounded authority to commit crimes that would neutralize the most fundamental check on executive power \u2013 the recognition and implementation of election results.\u201d Smith was appointed by US Attorney General Merrick Garland in November 2022. In August 2023, Smith brought four federal criminal counts against Trump in the election subversion case. A March 4 trial date was postponed as Trump pressed his immunity claim, with no new date yet set. Trump has three other pending criminal cases, with a trial in New York state court concerning hush money paid to a porn star set to begin on March 25. Trump has pleaded not guilty in all of them, seeking to portray them as politically motivated. Trump, in a post on his social media platform, hailed the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to hear his immunity claim. \u201cWithout Presidential Immunity, a President will not be able to properly function, or make decisions, in the best interest of the United States of America,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cPresidents will always be concerned, and even paralyzed, by the prospect of wrongful prosecution and retaliation after they leave office. This could actually lead to the extortion and blackmail of a President.\u201d Representatives for the special counsel\u2019s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Smith\u2019s charges accused Trump of conspiring to defraud the United States, obstructing the congressional certification of Biden\u2019s electoral victory and conspiring to do so, and conspiring against right of Americans to vote. Trump and his allies made false claims that the 2020 election was stolen and devised a plan to use false electors to thwart congressional certification of Biden\u2019s victory. Trump also sought to pressure then-Vice President Mike Pence not to allow certification to go forward. Trump\u2019s supporters attacked the Capitol in a bid to prevent the certification. If Trump regains the presidency, he could seek to use his powers to force an end to the prosecution or potentially pardon himself for any federal crimes. Trump last October sought to have the charges dismissed based on his claim of immunity. U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan rejected that claim in December. During January arguments in his appeal, one of Trump\u2019s lawyers told the D.C. Circuit judges that even if a president sold pardons or military secrets or ordered a Navy commando unit to assassinate a political rival, he could not be criminally charged unless he is first impeached and convicted in Congress. In its decision rejecting Trump\u2019s immunity claim, the three-judge panel wrote: \u201cWe cannot accept that the office of the presidency places its former occupants above the law for all time thereafter.\u201d Supreme Court justices during arguments on Feb. 8 signaled skepticism toward a ruling by Colorado\u2019s top court that barred Trump from the state\u2019s Republican primary ballot, based on the U.S. Constitution\u2019s 14th Amendment, after finding he engaged in an insurrection related to the Capitol attack. The Colorado and immunity cases put the Supreme Court in the election spotlight in the most direct way since its 2000 ruling that effectively handed the presidency to Republican George W. Bush over Democrat Al Gore. In a separate case to be argued on April 16, the Supreme Court has agreed to decide whether a man involved in the Capitol attack can be charged with obstructing an official proceeding \u2013 the congressional certification of the 2020 election results. That case has potential implications for Trump because Smith brought two obstruction-related charges. Weeks before the general elections, IE 100, the list of the 100 most powerful Indians this year, maps the lay of the land \u2014 the BJP holding strong, the Opposition trying to hold it together.

process, green card backlog, says US", "content": "US President Joe Biden is doing everything he can to improve the H1B visa process, \u2018green card\u2019 backlog and other issues related to the country\u2019s legal immigration system, the White House has said. The H1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise. \u201cOne of the steps, if we look at the H1B visa process, we have taken action to improve that and the process and backlog for lawful permanent residents (green card) who are eligible to become US citizens,\u201d White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters at her daily news conference on Wednesday. She was responding to questions about the feeling among a section of Indian Americans that the president is not putting as much effort on addressing the woes of legal immigrants as he is doing for illegal immigrants.\u00a0Biden heads to the southern border with Mexico in Texas on Thursday. \u201cJust last month, for example, as a part of our efforts to strengthen the integrity of our immigration system and reduce potential for fraud, the DHS published a final rule relating to H1B visa,\u201d Jean-Pierre said. \u201cSo, the changes promote fairer and more equitable outcomes and, so, we will continue our work to improve the system within our authorities and that has certainly been a priority,\u201d she said and added that the administration takes that \u201cvery seriously\u201d and is continuing to do everything that it can to improve the visa process. The US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has announced the launch of myUSCIS organisational accounts that will allow multiple people within an organisation, as well as their legal representatives, to collaborate on and prepare H1B registrations, H-1B petitions and any associated Form I-907, Request for Premium Processing Service. A new organisational account is required to participate in the H1B Electronic Registration Process starting in March 2024, the USCIS said. \u201cWe are working expeditiously to address any technical issues that may arise for legal representatives whose accounts migrated when they logged into their online account on or after February 14, 2024, including impacts on cases other than H1B filings,\u201d it said. The initial registration period for FY 2025 H1B cap will open at noon Eastern on March 6, and run through noon Eastern on March 22.\u00a0During this period, prospective petitioners and their representatives, if applicable, must use a USCIS online account to register each beneficiary electronically for the selection process and pay the associated registration fee for each beneficiary, its media alert said. Starting with the FY 2025 initial registration period, USCIS will require registrants to provide valid passport information or valid travel document information for each beneficiary.\u00a0The passport or travel document provided must be the one the beneficiary, if or when abroad, intends to use to enter the US if issued an H1B visa. Each beneficiary must only be registered under one passport or travel document. \u201cIn March, we will launch online filing of Form I-129 and associated Form I-907 for non-cap H1B petitions. On April 1, USCIS will begin accepting online filing for H1B cap petitions and associated Forms I-907 for petitioners whose registrations have been selected,\u201d the federal agency said. To help guide organisations and legal representatives through the new process, the USCIS had launched the Tech Talks sessions in February 2024. During these sessions, individuals can ask questions about the organisational accounts and online filing of Form I-129 for H1B petitions.\u00a0The USCIS encourages all individuals involved in the H1B registration and petition filing process to attend these sessions. Additional information and dates are available on the Upcoming National Engagements page, it said. Trinamool Congress leader Shahjahan Sheikh, wanted for land grab and sexual harassment cases, was arrested by West Bengal Police from Minakhan area. He had been on the run since January 5 when his supporters attacked ED officials. The Calcutta High Court had directed that he could be arrested by CBI, ED, or state police. Protests against his aides have caused tension between TMC and BJP.

"https://indianexpress.com/article/world/new-us-sanctions-more-likely-to-curb-indian-imports-of-russian-coal-says-traders-9187015/": {"source": "Indian Express", "headline": "New US sanctions more likely to curb Indian imports of Russian coal, says traders", "content": "New US sanctions on Moscow are more likely than previous ones to cut Indian imports of thermal coal from Russia because they specifically cite top exporters SUEK and Mechel, three major traders of Russian coal said. Russia, historically a minor exporter of the fuel to India, began boosting shipments to the south Asian country after Western sanctions against Moscow over its invasion ofUkraine. The latest US sanctions also include Russia\u2019s payment system, financial institutions and energy production. \u201cWith the new sanctions, I do not expect any of the big Indian companies to buy Russian cargoes,\u201d one major Indian trader told Reuters on the sidelines of the Coaltrans conference in the western Indian state ofGoa. The traders, two Indian and one Russian, declined to be named as they are not authorised to speak to the media. \u201cShipments of coal will still not stop, but people will be more hesitant to touch Russian cargoes,\u201d the second Indian trader said, adding that the sanctions could benefit other coal suppliers such as Indonesia, Australia and South Africa. Ship tracking data reviewed by Reuters shows Indian conglomerates JSW Group, Vedanta and consortium Arcelor Mittal Nippon Steel India were among the biggest importers of Russian thermal coal in the last six months. The three companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment on any potential impact from the new sanctions. SUEK, Russia\u2019s largest coal producer and exporter, did not reply to an email seeking comment. Reuters was not immediately able to reach Mechel for comment. Evidence of any immediate adverse impact of the new U.S. sanctions announced last week could not be ascertained, as cargoes of thermal coal typically take more than two weeks to sail from Russia to India. Russian supplies of thermal coal rose by 19% in 2023 to 10.06 million metric tons, or nearly 6% of Indian imports of the fuel, consultancy Bigmint said. India\u2019s trade ministry had no immediate comment on the impact of the sanctions on trade with Russia, but in a note on Wednesday the oil ministry highlighted \u201clongstanding ties\u201d with Moscow and future plans for partnerships across sectors. India had become the biggest buyer of Russian seaborne crude since the start of the Ukraine war, a trade that also faces hurdles from the new U.S. sanctions. While expanding trade with Moscow since Western sanctions following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, NewDelhihas consistently called for \u201ccomplete cessation of all hostilities\u201d, including in the note released by the oil ministry\u00a0on\u00a0Wednesday. Vaqeel Hasan, leader of a team of miners who rescued 41 workers in Uttarakhand, returned home to find it demolished in an anti-encroachment drive. Despite pleading, his house was the only one targeted. Hasan, a father of three, emphasizes the need for unity after their heroic mission.

infection led to the Dutch obsession with tulips", "content": "Bright yellow, vibrant crimson, mauve lined with pink, red stroked with white, and more \u2014rows and rows of tulips adorn Delhiin February. Photographers, Instagrammers and languid strollers can\u2019t seem to get enough of the burst of spring colours that make for a stunning sight. Therecent popularity of tulips in the national capitalreminds one of the frenzy that the flower had once caused in Europe, in the Netherlands to be precise. The \u2018tulipomania\u2019, as it came to be called, had shaken the entire nation and nearly brought its economy to ruins. Although tulips today are almost exclusively associated with the Netherlands, the flower did not originate here. A native of Central Asia, the tulips had been imported to the Netherlands from Constantinople. Lesser known though is the role played by a viral infection that led to the madness around tulips in Holland. Tulips are known to have evolved from lilies in East Asia some 21 million years ago. It was cultivated in the western slopes of the Tien Shan mountains in Kazakhstan, extending up to central Crimea. In Kazakhstan, the flower was used as food by nomads and herders. However, long before the flower became the exotic prized possession in the Netherlands, its beauty was already being celebrated in the East. The Persians were the first ones to remark upon the wondrous sight of the tulip from the 11th century onwards. For them, tulips marked the beginning of spring. From paintings on tiles and clothing to poetry, the Persians used tulips as a motif for grace and beauty.\u201cIn one of his most famous verses, Omar Khayyam used the tulip as a metaphor for perfect female beauty,\u201dwrites biochemist Pranay Lal in his book,\u2018Invisible Empire: The Natural History of Viruses\u2019(2021).Be it Shiraz, Baghdad, Constantinople, Samarkand, Peshawar or Srinagar, by the 15th century, the tulip had found its way to every city where the Persians and Turks enjoyed a presence. Replacing the more conventional flowers such as dahlias, roses and hyacinths, the tulips became the leitmotif of Islam\u2019s vision of paradise. In the Ottoman Empire, a specific kind of tulip was in fact most valued. These were the ones with absurdly long petals, drawn to a point fine as a needle. The American author and journalist Michael Pollan in his book,\u2018The Botany of Desire\u2019(2001) notes that \u201cthe metaphor of choice for this form of tulip petal was the dagger.\u201dHe points out that for a time in the 18th century, the bulbs of tulips that matched the Turkish ideal were traded in Constantinople for quantities of gold. For that matter, the reign of Sultan Ahmed III from 1703 to 1730 was known to Turkish historians as \u2018lale devri\u2019or the tulip era. Driven by mad passion for the flower, each year he would import millions of tulips from Holland that had by then become masters of large-scale tulip bulb production. The Sultan would organise an annual tulip festival, the extravagance of which is said to have ultimately led to his downfall. Pollan in his book provides a detailed description of the Ottoman Sultan\u2019s tulip festival.\u201cEach spring for a period of weeks the imperial gardens were filled with prize tulips (Turkish, Dutch, Irania) all of them shown to their best advantage,\u201dhe writes. Each variety was marked with a label made of silver filigree. Further, songbirds in gilded cages were placed to provide music and hundreds of giant tortoises with candles on their backs moved around the gardens. Pollan remarks,\u201cAt the appointed moment a cannon sounded, the doors to the harem were flung open, and the sultan\u2019s mistresses stepped into the garden led by eunuchs bearing torches.\u201dThis whole scene was repeated every night of the tulip season. The conspicuous waste of national money that was carried out to arrange this spectacle eventually ignited a revolt that led to the end of the Sultan\u2019s rule. It was in 1554 that the tulips were first introduced to Europe. Ogier Ghislain de Busbecq, the ambassador of the Austrian Hapsburgs to the court of Suleiyman the Magnificent in Constantinople, sent a consignment of tulip bulbs to the West.\u201cThe fact that the tulips first official trip west took it from one court to another- that it was a flower favoured by royalty- may also have contributed to its quick ascendancy, for court fashions have always been especially catching,\u201dwrites Pollan. Carolus Clausius, the man who brought the tulip to the Netherlands, was known to be one of the greatest botanists of his time. He is credited with the introduction and spread of hyacinths, lilies, narcissi among others across Europe. He first encountered the tulip during a trip to the Iberian Peninsula in the 1560s. From there he brought a cartload of tulip bulbs to the court of Maximilian II of Hapsburg-Austria. In 1573, Clausius was commissioned to design the royal gardens in Vienna, where the tulips were to find a most special place. However, on being dismissed by Maximilian II\u2019s successor Rudolf II in 1577, he left for Holland with his tulip collection. There he created Holland\u2019s first bed of tulips at a nursery in Leiden University in 1593. Being close to aristocrats and merchants, it was not too difficult for Clausius to make the tulip an object of desire that spread far and wide all over the Netherlands. In a matter of two decades, by 1620, tulips became the most prized possession in almost every house and garden of the Netherlands.\u201cTulips were perhaps the first living plant to become central to the drawing room,\u201dwrites Lal.\u201cThey were planted in expensive Chinese and decorative Deft porcelain vases, and in Venetian crystal bowls placed on windowsills and lined up on porticos and anterooms.\u201d The horticultural writer Anna Pavord in her book,The Tulip (1999), writes that among rich merchants of Holland in the 17th century, fountains, aviaries of rare birds, and temples in the Greek style were standard accouterments of the garden.\u201cBut the tulip was the ultimate status symbol, the definitive emblem of how much you were worth,\u201dshe writes. Those who could not afford the flower themselves commissioned the greatest among the Dutch artists to paint tulips for them. It was inevitable perhaps that tulipomania also brought tulipophobia in its wake. Pavord in an email interview withindianexpress.compoints to the story of the professor of Botany at Leiden University who grew to loathe tulips. So much so that he \u201cattacked them savagely wherever they stood, thwacking them soundly with his cane.\u201d What explains this Dutch obsession with a flower? explains that \u201cit was partly a matter of timing,\u201d explains Pavord.\u00a0\u201cThe Dutch East India Company had been set up in 1602 and this, combined with Amsterdam\u2019s increasing importance as a port, marked the beginning of an era of great prosperity for the Dutch. Merchants got rich and in their wake, lawyers, doctors, pharmacists and jewellers too,\u201d she says. Pavord explains that the Dutch, the superb marketeers they were, were \u201cquick to recognise new markets, such as the US, where Dutch and German immigrants were establishing new communities in Pennsylvania and Ohio. Six hundred different kinds of tulips were bedded out on Long Island in the spring of 1845.\u201d Pollan in his book notes that in the 17th century, the Dutch were the richest people in Europe and did not shy away from indulging in the conspicuous display of wealth. It must be noted that up until then, flowers in Europe were valued only if they served some utilitarian purpose. As observed by Pollan, when the tulip first arrived in Europe, people went about finding ways to make it useful. The Germans, for instance, boiled and sugared the bulbs and declared them a delicacy, though they were not successful. The English too tried to turn them into edible products. That too failed.\u201cThe tulip was a thing of beauty, no more, no less,\u201dwrites the 20th century poet Zbigniew Herbert in his celebrated essay on tulipomania,\u2018The Bitter Smell of Tulip\u2019. The tulip\u2019s uselessness though was precisely what suited the Dutch taste of extravagance. While acquiring the most beautiful tulip became the latest fad in 17th century Netherlands, it was the variegated kind that was most in demand. \u201cThe flower had a unique trick that dangerously added to its other attractions,\u201d comments Pavord. \u201cIt could change colour seemingly at will. A plain red tulip might emerge the following spring in a completely different guise, the petals feathered and flamed in intricate patterns of yellow.\u201d \u201cEach tulip would look different and have a personality and beauty of its own,\u201d Lal tells indianexpress.com. \u201cThis was unlike any other flower like the marigold or chrysanthemum, which in a bunch would all look alike.\u201d It is the magical and unpredictable nature of tulips that drove up its prices. Lal in his book observes that\u201clike art, the price of tulips was driven by whim, wealth and outright greed.\u201d\u201cA single bulb once sold for the price of a sailing ship laden with exotic goods from the East Indies. A pot with two bulbs of \u2018broken\u2019 tulips could fetch as much as a hundred times the salary of a skilled craftsman. A bulb of a very rare tulip could pay for five commissioned paintings by Rembrandt.\u201d Pollan in his book notes that if a tulip broke in a particularly striking manner, for instance, if the streaks and stripes were perfectly symmetrical, the owner of the bulb would have won a lottery. They would command a fantastic price.\u201cThe fact that broken tulips for some unknown reason produced fewer and smaller offsets than ordinary tulips drove their prices still higher,\u201dhe writes, noting that the Semper Augustus tulip was the most famous among such breaks. Though tulip lovers did not know it back then, these breaks in colours were being caused by a virus. Up until the 1880s, the word \u2018virus\u2019 was not understood in the modern sense at all. It was as late as the 1920s and after the invention of the electron microscope that researchers began to unravel its true nature. Until then, tulip growers came up with ingenious ways and means to cause vibrant bursts of colours. \u201cSome, taking cue from contemporary alchemists, laid powdered paint on their tulip beds, expecting the colours miraculously to affect the flowers,\u201d remarks Pavord. The insane demand for broken tulips led to a near catastrophe in the economy of Holland by 1637. By the mid-1630s, trading and speculation over tulips were common in taverns and backrooms. Just before the spring blossom of 1637, rumour was rife of particularly wondrous streaked tulips to hit the market. Traders advised their clients that such streaked tulips would be very few in number and hence would fetch a very high price. However, what occurred thereafter was the complete opposite. The speculators were proven wrong and by March an abundance of broken tulips had flooded the Dutch markets. Consequently, the prices started dropping drastically, bringing ruin to traders and ending the phase of \u2018tulipomania\u2019 in Holland. Lal points out that it was only much later in the 1980s that scientists came to understand how \u2018breaking\u2019 was happening in tulips and affecting its petals. The virus responsible was known as potyvirus, which was spread by aphids commonly found in plants like plum, peach and potatoes. \u201cIt was a chance encounter that in 17th century Holland, tulips were being grown in close proximity to these plants. So the virus found a new plant to infect,\u201d says Lal. In his book, Lal explains that when the virus infected the tulip plant, it suppressed the production of a dominant pigment called \u2018anthocyanin\u2019 in the flower\u2019s petals but left the base colour unchanged.\u201cEach viral infection creates a unique and different type of streaks, stripes, feathers and flames because of the irregular distribution of anthocyanin in every petal,\u201dhe writes. Once cultivators understood that the beauty of the broken tulip was caused by a virus, they no longer planted them in their gardens and fields, because of the fear of the virus destroying agricultural crops and other tulips as well. \u201cThe botanical societies of the world decided that only those tulip plants that are virus-resistant would be planted and that they needed to stop this viral infection in species,\u201d says Lal. Although \u2018tulipomania\u2019 among the Dutch was never replicated, they did resume cultivation of tulips in the early 20th century, becoming the largest producer of the flower over time. At present, the global market is dominated by the monotone Darwin tulips and strict sanitary procedures are followed to ensure there are no viral outbreaks. One can still occasionally come across tulips though that stand out for the streaks and stipples of colours on them. These, as Lal explains, are caused by genetic variation and not a viral infection. The modern-day tulip festivals are inspired by the flower\u2019s Dutch connection. \u201cIt was the clever Dutch who turned the tulip from a \u201cjewel\u201d flower into a flower for bedding out en masse,\u201d says Pavord. Apart from Amsterdam, tulip festivals are held in most parts of the world where a Dutch historical connection existed. One of the largest tulip festivals in the world for instance takes place in Ottawa, Canada where the Dutch royal family had sent tulip bulbs as a gift for the assistance provided by the former during the Second World War. In India, where also the tulip festivals have become an annual affair, the Dutch have had a long historical presence as traders and colonisers. Pavord points out, indigenous tulips can be found in the wild in India too. \u201cBut I doubt the festival being planned for New Delhi will be of indigenous wild tulips,\u201d she says. \u201cHowever, India has such a wealth of wonderful plants of its own, I wonder why it needs to turn to tulips for a festival.\u201d Further reading: Anna Pavord,\u2018The Tulip\u2019, Bloomsbury Publishing Plc, 1999 Pranay Lal,\u2018Invisible Empire: The Natural History of Viruses\u2019, Penguin Viking, 2021 Michael Pollan,\u2018The Botany of Desire: A Plant\u2019s Eye View of the World\u2019,Random House Publishing Group, 2001 Weeks before scheme scrapped, Govt printed EBs worth Rs 8,350crSubscriber Only UPSC Key, February 28: What to read today and whySubscriber Only Is Lord Krishna\u2019s Dwarka under water?

Express", "headline": "Manipur Budget session: Speaker allows discussion today on conflict", "content": "As many as 10 MLAs representing the Kuki-Zomi community were absent from the Budget Session of the Manipur Assembly that began on Wednesday. Speaker Thokchom Satyabrata gave his nod for a short-duration discussion on Thursday on the ongoing crisis in the state. The current Assembly session is the second to take place since the outbreak of ethnic violence in the state on May 3 last year. The previous session was only a day-long on August 29, and it lasted all of 11 minutes, ending without any mention of the violence in the state. The 10 Kuki-Zomi members had not attended the last session too. Satyabrata agreed for the short-duration discussion on the conflict on Thursday following an appeal by Congress MLA K. Meghachandra. While presenting theBudgetEstimate for 2024-2025, CM\u00a0 Minister N Biren Singh said that the ongoing conflict has severely impacted the fiscal capacity of the state. \u201cThe current financial year has been the hardest for our government,\u201d he said. Trinamool Congress leader Shahjahan Sheikh, wanted for land grab and sexual harassment cases, was arrested by West Bengal Police from Minakhan area. He had been on the run since January 5 when his supporters attacked ED officials. The Calcutta High Court had directed that he could be arrested by CBI, ED, or state police. Protests against his aides have caused tension between TMC and BJP.

officials\u2019, TIPRA Motha\u2019s Pradyot leaves fast venue for Delhi", "content": "It started with thunderous applause and ended with a phone call. A much-hyped \u201cfast-unto-death\u201d in Tripura byTIPRA Motha founder Pradyot Kishore Debbarmawas cut short on Wednesday by a phone call that he said invited him to a meeting with the central government over his demands. While he rushed to NewDelhiafter the phone call, Pradyot said he would break his fast only after getting a written assurance from the central government. Asked who called him from Delhi, Pradyot said it would not be proper to reveal names on a public stage but added that \u201cofficials of the central government\u201d called him. Pradyot had announced his fast to press for the party\u2019s demands for Greater Tipralandand direct central funding and greater power for the Tripura Tribal AreasAutonomous DistrictCouncil (TTAADC), among others. It was three days ago that Pradyot returned from New Delhi after an inconclusive meeting with the central government. A large stage, resting sheds covered with tarpaulin sheets, makeshift washrooms and galleries were arranged for the fast at Hatai Kotor, the rechristened official name of the Baramura Hills range in West Tripura. Amid thundering claps from the nearly 30,000 supporters from different tribal communities who almost jammed National Highway 8, Pradyot Kishore arrived at the protest venue at 11 am. He performed a Kshatriya Puja organised by the Khsatriya Samaj for welfare of his health and the tribal community before joining his party colleagues on stage. Pradyot was through his speech for only 15 minutes when Motha leader Animesh Debbarma received a call and passed the phone to him. A phone call, a few nods, musing to himself after disconnecting the call and then came the big news, \u201cI have to go to Delhi. Got a call\u201d. Amid conch shells from supporters who took it as a big win for the tribal community, the royal scion-turned-politician asked his supporters to return home but asked party leaders to stay back. He said the hunger strike was suspended but added that he would call it off by breaking the fast in Tripura if a positive written assurance came during his Delhi visit. Pradyot urged his supporters to wait for a final word from New Delhi. \u201cDon\u2019t celebrate too fast. Don\u2019t repeat the mistake from the past. Don\u2019t take yourself lightly. Hold on. Delhi has called. I\u2019ll go. I\u2019ll talk. But I will not compromise,\u201d he said, in an oblique reference to a week-long National Highway blockade held at the same place in 2017 by the Indigenous Peoples Front of Tripura, which is now theBJP\u2019s ruling ally in the state. Many IPFT supporters, who had even staged a naked protest at the time, had celebrated saying the separate statehood demand was agreed to after the central government announced a plan to form a high-power modality committee under the home ministry. However, six years later, the Centre and the BJP still have not agreed to the demand. While a series of discussions were already held with the central government, Pradyot appeared confident of some positive end to the current agitation. \u201cI\u2019ll go to Delhi on an empty stomach. I\u2019ll not eat anything till we get anything. I need all your blessings. I\u2019ll get a constitutional solution for tribals,\u201d he said. Pradyot had held a series of talks with AK Mishra, the home ministry\u2019s advisor on Northeast affairs. Pradyot said in his speech, \u201cWhen I was young, my mother used to tell me what our state used to be and what we are now. I felt since childhood that injustice was done with Haa-ni Bwsa (son of the soil). He also trained guns at the Congress, Left Front and BJP governments that have ruled the state. \u201cElections came and every five years and tribals voted in response to big speeches but they got nothing. We should seek an apology from you, the leaders, because you couldn\u2019t give us justice over the past 75 years. Leaders sold out, forgot the community for lal batti, bungalows and some other benefits. I left the Congress and came to the TIPRA Motha. I spent money from my own pocket, fought for you, got abused, insulted but never sold or forsook you,\u201d he said. Pradyot said that he felt politics had become cheap and that politicians were closer to contractors than people. \u201cEveryone speaks about thansa (tribal unity). But in reality, thansa isn\u2019t there. If thansa were there, Maharaj wouldn\u2019t need to speak to you on an empty stomach and with teary eyes. We need the thansa of the community, not leaders,\u201d he said. Pradyot questioned the state of affairs asking why tribals had to protest for the right to write their own language in a script of their choice or had to walk kilometres for water. He also mentioned the high rate of unemployment, where 27,000 people apply for 100 jobs in the Tripura ADC. Pradyot\u2019s fast venue had no party flags, including those of TIPRA Motha\u2019s, as he wanted the protest to be non-partisan. Motha has grounded its political discourse on ethnic identity and claims that tribals have been historically deprived since the erstwhile princely state joined the Indian Union in 1949. It swept the tribal council polls two months after it was floated in 2021 and has emerged as the principal Opposition party with 13 MLAs in the 60-member Assembly. Trinamool Congress leader Shahjahan Sheikh, wanted for land grab and sexual harassment cases, was arrested by West Bengal Police from Minakhan area. He had been on the run since January 5 when his supporters attacked ED officials. The Calcutta High Court had directed that he could be arrested by CBI, ED, or state police. Protests against his aides have caused tension between TMC and BJP.

"https://indianexpress.com/article/parenting/financial-literacy-for-teens-money-management-tips-9178187/": {"source": "Indian Express", "headline": "Money matters: How to teach your teen financial literacy", "content": "Today\u2019s kids are intelligent, quick learners, tech-savvy, and perceptive. They become habituated even more quickly than we think. At a young age, they begin to identify their needs, wants, and way of life. However, they may overlook the fact that investing and conserving money are essential for a stable and contented future. With the rise in digital currency, it becomes tough even for adults to keep track of their finances, hence it is significant to educate your teen from a young age aboutfinancial literacy. Here\u2019s what you can do: First and foremost, talk to your kids about needs vs. wants. Inform them that purchasing that pricey toy will require savings. Discuss how we save money now so that we can later obtain the items we want. Encourage your children to prioritise saving by setting aside their wants. Request the amount they have chosen to save and assure them that you will securely store it on their behalf. It is very important that your teen learns how to manage and document their finances. Since digital payments create an illusion of spending less, writing down their daily or weekly finances will help your child overcome this illusion. Providing them with a finance diary where they can record their expenses and savings will help them keep track. Unfortunately, our schools don\u2019t teach the basics of how to file a complaint in a bank, how to open a fixed deposit, or how to get access to a passbook, etc. Hence, as parents, it\u2019s essential that you take your teen to a bank every quarter so that they understand the practicalities of opening a bank account and what is required. Your child might initially show either no interest or be extremely excited. In both cases, be patient with them.Answer their querieswith a general sense of calmness and confidence. They might require you to explain something more than once. Instead of showing annoyance, try using simpler analogies so that your teen can relate. Make learning enjoyable as much as possible. Introduce ideas and lessons from life, such as the importance of financial literacy, using board games. A range of lessons on money management, financial planning, negotiating, and career planning can be learned from board games such as Monopoly, Game of Life, and the Stock Exchange. These games can be a useful tool for teaching lessons about prudentmoney management, saving, and investing in banks, stocks, and real estate, and using money for emergencies rather than hoarding.

Express", "headline": "For older Indians, walking 9,000 steps every day is the best way to cut risk of heart attack by 50 per cent", "content": "Have you ever wondered why Indians carry such a disease burden? That\u2019s because over 50 per cent of Indians do not meet the minimum physical activity recommendation by the World Health Organisation (WHO) of at least 150 minutes per week ofmoderate intensity physical activity. \u201cThere is a lack of awareness about physical activity guidelines. Hence, simpler metrics such as counting steps can be useful to promote physical activity in India,\u201d says Shivangi Bajpai, a doctoral student at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst Department of Kinesiology, US. She along with lead author Dr Amanda Paluch, Assistant Professor at University of Massachusetts, recently published a study titledProspectiver Association Of Daily Steps withCardiovascular Disease: A harmonized meta-analysisin the journal Circulation. The study suggests that people over 60 may significantly reduce their risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) by walking between 6,000-9,000 steps per day. Researchers, who analysed data from over 20,000 people in the US and 42 other countries, found that compared to people who walked 2,000 steps per day, those walking between 6,000 and 9,000 steps daily had a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, including heart attacks and strokes, by 40 per cent to 50 per cent. According to Bajpai, some of the cultural and social problems in India can be attributed to decline in physical activity post-retirement. \u201cWalking to work and at work constitute a major part of physical activity patterns among working Indians which needs to be replaced by other recreational physical activities after retirement. Retirement may lead to social isolation, loss of sense of purpose, and decline in physical and mental health. Therefore, this could be a critical time to intervene and help them integrate different ways to be sufficiently active,\u201d Bajpai explained. Although the trend is changing, most Indian households have defined gender roles, where household responsibilities still fall on women. This provides women very little time to engage in recreational physical activity. There is also a misconception among Indian women that they engage in sufficient physical activities through their household chores. While this could be true to some extent, steps such as physical activity metrics through the wearable device could help them monitor their daily activity and help them develop self-awareness, the researcher said. Monitoring steps can also help adults with existing chronic illnesses. India has a high rate of incidence of coronary artery disease (CAD),diabetesand high death rate due to cardiovascular diseases. People with existing conditions may find it easier to set a step target for themselves and work on slowly increasing their daily steps to prevent further health decline, Bajpai observed. Dr Paluch also noted that the study findings of the associations of steps per day with cardiovascular diseases were much stronger in older adults than younger adults. \u201cCVD is a disease of ageing and often doesn\u2019t occur until we are at older ages. In our study, we considered CVD a diagnosis of stroke, heart failure, or heart attack and these conditions are much less likely to occur at younger ages. For younger adults, being physically active benefits many of the precursors of cardiovascular disease, such as high blood pressure, obesity, and Type 2 diabetes. These conditions are more likely to develop in younger adults and are important for early prevention of cardiovascular disease,\u201d Dr Paluch said.

"headline": "Russian space officials say air leak at International Space Station poses no danger to its crew", "content": "Russian space officials on Wednesday acknowledged a continuing air leak from the Russian segment of the International Space Station, but said it poses no danger to its crew. The Roscosmos state corporation said that specialists were monitoring the leak and the crew \u201cregularly conducts work to locate and fix possible spots of the leak.\u201d \u201cThere is no threat to the crew or the station itself,\u201d it said in a statement carried by Russian news agencies. Roscosmos\u2019 statement followed comments by Joel Montalbano, NASA\u2019s station project manager, who noted Wednesday that the leak in the Russian segment has increased but emphasized that it remains small and poses no threat to the crew\u2019s safety or vehicle operations. As the space outpost is aging, the crew has to spend more time to repair and maintain it, Roscosmos said. Russian space officials first reported a leak in the Zvezda module in August 2020 and later that year Russian crew members located what they believed was its source and tried to fix it. In November 2021, another potentially leaky spot was found in a different part of the Russian section of the station.Also Read|OnePlus introduces 12R Genshin Impact Edition with a custom gift boxBoth Roscosmos and NASA have said the leak posed no danger to the crew and didn\u2019t impact operations on the station. There have been other glitches too. In October, coolant leaked from an external backup radiator for Russia\u2019s new science lab Nauka (Science), although its main thermal control system was working normally and space officials said the crew and the station weren\u2019t in danger. That incident followed coolant leaks from Russian spacecraft parked at the station. In December 2022, coolant leaked from a Soyuz crew capsule docked to the station, and another similar leak from a Progress supply ship was discovered in February 2023. A Russian investigation concluded that those leaks likely resulted from hits by tiny meteoroids, not manufacturing flaws. The space station, which has served as a symbol of post-Cold War international cooperation, is now one of the last remaining areas of cooperation between Russia and the West amid the tensions over Moscow\u2019s military action in Ukraine. NASA and its partners hope to continue operating the orbiting outpost until 2030. The station\u2019s current crew consists of NASA astronauts Jasmin Moghbeli and Loral O\u2019Hara, the European Space Agency\u2019s Andreas Mogensen, Russian cosmonauts Konstantin Borisov, Oleg Kononenko and Nikolai Chub and Japanese astronaut Satoshi Furukawa. Trinamool Congress leader Shahjahan Sheikh, wanted for land grab and sexual harassment cases, was arrested by West Bengal Police from Minakhan area. He had been on the run since January 5 when his supporters attacked ED officials. The Calcutta High Court had directed that he could be arrested by CBI, ED, or state police. Protests against his aides have caused tension between TMC and BJP.

Today, Feb 29, 2024: Check astrological prediction for Virgo, Leo and other signs", "content": "As from today, children will be an increasingly important element in your life. You may take this literally or follow a metaphorical path and understand that it is time to liberate what psychologists call \u2018the inner child\u2019, the part of you which never grew up, becoming more joyful and spontaneous in the process. Circumstances beyond your control may be compelling you into family arrangements which are not of your choosing. If you find current developments unwelcome it would be very useful to check out any little way in which you have yourself contributed to the situation. Life is moving on day by day and week by week, and you will soon need to be an expert on everything. The more you know, the better off you\u2019ll be, so you\u2019ll have to keep the facts at your fingertips. You\u2019ll also need to understand the inner meaning of today\u2019s events! You needn\u2019t expect to have your usual amount of drive and determination over the next few weeks. It seems increasingly obvious that you are heading for a period which is ideal for rest, reflection and recuperation. Your zest for life is soon to increase, so enjoy it. It is difficult not to be totally awestruck by the truly splendid pattern which is now building up in your sign. The good news is that there is more to come, but when you are showered with opportunities, as you will soon be, you must learn to discriminate between what is worthwhile and what is not. Astrological tradition has it that you are deeply concerned with the movement and subtle phases of Mercury. According to this planet, your mood is now to become more analytical and communicative, which should do you a power of good. Look after yourself \u2013 you deserve only the best! Children and younger relatives need a firm hand. The stars indicate a need for authority, yet in my opinion they are a mite too inflexible. You may therefore wish to be absolutely firm as regards your principles, but judge each situation on its merits. Financial affairs will soon require more thought. Among other things, this means that you must talk to partners about your spending plans. Tell them what you\u2019re doing, and they\u2019ll almost certainly go along with you. Your romantic hopes are rising, by the way, but they may be too high to be met. The romantic situation is looking positively rosy, although it does seem that, if one arrangement is to be confirmed, there must be a break in another. You can at least maintain an atmosphere of goodwill and cooperation with a particular person, even if your spirit has moved on. If you take on too many new engagements or projects, you may let yourself in for a number of false starts. It could be far better to stick with what you know and concentrate on building up your future security. Then, you\u2019ll be able to launch an adventurous initiative from a firm base. Your daily transits indicate the need to complete shopping and financial exercises first, and then discuss the relevant issues and consequences. Do yourself a favour and look for ways to make life more enjoyable. And don\u2019t be annoyed by unreliable partners or colleagues. They may not be able to help it! You must now convey your true feelings. It may be that you will do well if you concentrate on making the right impression, but if you are to convince family members, you must have a healthy grasp of the facts. It\u2019s no use relying on them to agree with you, just because you\u2019re you! The city of Dwarka, Lord Krishna's ancient abode, is considered a significant pilgrimage site and is believed to have been submerged under the sea after Krishna's death. Scholars have suggested different locations for the exact site of Dwarka, and excavations on land and underwater have revealed artefacts from different time periods, but the search for the submerged city continues.

Instituted in 2017 by the French Institute in India, it recognises translations of French books into Indian languages, including English. On his win, Chatterjee said in a statement, \u201cI am delighted as my firsttranslationfrom French into Bengali has been honoured with the prize. I am grateful to the French Institute in India for their support during the past two years \u2013 from arranging funds under the Tagore (publication assistance) programme to my selection as the awardee. I expect more and more French books will be translated into Bengali. I promise to do so.\u201d This is the second time a Bengali translator has won the prize, with Trinanjan Chakraborty winning for Kamel Daoud\u2019sMeursault, contre-enqu\u00eatein 2022. Chatterjee\u2019s publisher, Pankaj Kumar Basak, of New Bharat Sahitya Kutir, said, \u201cI am encouraged by the award conferred on the book published by me.

At Oxford Bookstores, we understand the vital role that translations play in enriching the literary landscape, exploring new cultures, perspectives, and ideas, breaking down barriers while fostering a deeper appreciation for the diverse beauty of global literature.\u201d Emmanuel Lebrun-Damiens, Director of the French Institute in India, said, \u201cBaltassat belongs to a tradition of French writers excelling in the art of historical fiction.

in Bangladesh: An Untold Story is disturbing but necessary", "content": "Written by Tanvi Manhas Why is a new book needed for something already recorded in history? Because either history failed to give the full picture, or was written to suit a few. So it is with Bangladesh, a nation born of strife and bloodshed.Being Hindu in Bangladesh: An Untold Storybrings to the fore personal stories of Hindu persecution in the nation \u2014 from the district of Noakhali before Partition, the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War, the violence during Durga Puja in 2021, and many more. Bangladesh\u2019s Hindu population, at a meagre 9 per cent today, compared to 1947\u2019s 30 per cent, belies the nation\u2019s claim of a secular ethos. To understand what really happened to their homeland between 1947 and 2002, journalist Deep Halder and academic Avishek Biswas travelled extensively across Bangladesh and West Bengal to assemble a comprehensive and incisive report of East Pakistan\u2019s transition to a secular Bangladesh, and its journey thereon. What emerges is an account of a nation habitually going rogue on its minorities, amply documented in news, public speeches and views expressed by public personalities. Also disclosed are the current dispensation\u2019s challenges in creating an inclusive and secular Bangladesh, united by culture and language. After many pages, you may want to put the book down just to breathe, given the unrelenting documentation of atrocities. A beacon in this desolate panorama is a section of Muslims who are vociferous about redeeming the secularity promised by Banglabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. But these voices are far too few. Trinamool Congress leader Shahjahan Sheikh, wanted for land grab and sexual harassment cases, was arrested by West Bengal Police from Minakhan area. He had been on the run since January 5 when his supporters attacked ED officials. The Calcutta High Court had directed that he could be arrested by CBI, ED, or state police. Protests against his aides have caused tension between TMC and BJP.

{"source": "Indian Express", "headline": "Express Investigation with Forbidden Stories | Accused in Maharashtra journalist\u2019s murder linked to web of land deals", "content": "TODAY MARKS one full year sincejournalist Shashikant Warishe, 48, was killed allegedly for opposing a Central refinery project in Maharashtra\u2019s Ratnagiri district alleging environmental violations. The prime accused, Pandharinath Amberkar, is in jail facing charges including that of murder and destroying evidence. He is alleged to have rammed Warishe\u2019s scooter with his SUV and run him over. Not only did Amberkar threaten Warishe with death, as the chargesheet filed by the Ratnagiri Police states, he and his network of family members were involved in a slew of land transactions in and around villages where the project is proposed, an investigation byThe Indian Expressin collaboration with Paris-based consortium Forbidden Stories, has revealed. The project is being executed by Ratnagiri Refinery Petrochemicals Ltd (RRPCL), a company set up in 2017, and jointly owned by state-owned Indian Oil Corporation, BPCL Ltd and HPCL Ltd. Initially, the project was proposed in Nanar village in Ratnagiri district, but following opposition by locals and environment activists, the Maharashtra government wrote to the Centre in January 12, 2022, that it would identify 13,000 acres for acquisition in Barsu village in Rajapur city, for the project. But work stalled after large protests by locals early 2023 when the state government started survey work and soil testing in Barsu, forcing the administration to deploy a huge police force. An investigation of land records of the past three years shows that the accused, Pandharinath Amberkar; his sister Pratiksha Khadpe; and his nephew (cousin\u2019s son) Akshay Amberkar; are linked to more than 30 land transactions covering over 10.2 hectares and worth an estimated Rs 2.8 crore. That\u2019s not all, police records also reveal that RRPCL paid Rs 4.44 lakh to Pandharinath Amberkar in December 2022 in lieu of \u201clogistics services.\u201d Amberkar himself bought six land parcels, sold one, and held the Power of Attorney (PoA) for eight others, representing the buyer or the seller, records show. Total worth of these transactions: Rs 80.64 lakh Of the six parcels he bought between September 2021 and June 2022, four totalling 1.07 hectares are in Barsu village, and two in Dhopeshwar village totalling 0.674 hectares. He paid Rs 47.29 lakh for these six land parcels and sold one. In one transaction, he held the PoA for Pratiksha Khadpe, his sister, who purchased a 0.11 hectare land parcel on March 3, 2022, for Rs 50,000. Khadpe was also a corporator representing theShiv Sena(when it was undivided) in Rajapur Municipal Council, and had voted in favour of the refinery when a resolution was moved in 2021. She purchased the plot in the name of her minor son and one Vaishnavi Amberkar. When contacted, Pratiksha Khadpe said, \u201cSince the case is still in the court we are not able to give you any comment.\u201d Akshay Amberkar, Pandharinath Amberkar\u2019s nephew who worked closely with him, is also involved in 19 land transactions (8.41 hectares) between October 2021 and April 2023, valued at over Rs 2 crore. In all these, he held the Power of Attorney for either the seller or the buyer of land. In five of the 19 deals, he held the PoA for Kiran Achrekar, who retired from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation as Deputy Municipal Commissioner, and purchased 5.195 hectares cumulatively in Nate, Panhale Rajapur and Solgaon, villages for Rs 1.72 crore. Kiran Achrekar and Akshay Amberkar did not respond to repeated queries and calls by The Indian Express. Amberkar is in Ratnagiri Central Jail and the lower court has denied him bail. In the application, Amberkar claimed the collision was a \u201cpure accident\u201d and blamed his automatic car, which had \u201cgone out of his control as he jumbled between the accelerator and (the) brake.\u201d He has filed for bail in the Bombay High Court, which is yet to be heard. A supporter of the refinery project, Pandharinath Amberkar also provided logistics services to RRPCL, according to the 1,190-page chargesheet filed in May 2023 by the Special Investigation Team led by the Deputy Superintendent of Police in Ratnagiri. Sai Krupa Travels, of which Amberkar is the proprietor, was paid Rs 4.44 lakh by RRPCL in December 2022, the chargesheet says. RRPCL PRO Anil Nagvekar did not respond to a detailed set of questions fromThe Indian Express. In his statement to the police on February 24, 2023, Nagvekar had said he got acquainted with Pandharinath during a tour organised by RRPCL to the Panipat refinery project for 24-25 villagers and journalists. \u201cAfter that, around December 2021, MIDC officers and officers of other companies came 3-4 times to Barsu, Solgaon and Nate villages for survey. At that time, a contact was established with Pandharinath Amberkar to rent his car. He has provided his Duster/Safari vehicles at times as per the demands of company officials. Apart from this, Pandharinath Amberkar has no relation with RRPCL company or officers,\u201d Nagvekar told the police. In its chargesheet, the Ratnagiri police said, \u201cThe accused Pandharinath Amberkar was working as a supporter of the planned refinery project in and around Barsu village\u2026 Amberkar had invested and purchased land parcels in the refinery project area in his own name and that of his relatives.\u201d Pandharinath Amberkar\u2019s lawyers, advocate-on-record Sachin Bandkar and counsel Anil Singh and Ashish Chavan said they cannot comment since the matter was sub judice. Warishe\u2019s killing is not the only allegation against Amberkar in relation to the refinery project. At least four other criminal cases were registered against him for assaulting and intimidating protesters of the refinery. In 2020, Amberkar had tried to allegedly run over 21-year-old local resident and activist Manoj Mayekar. In that incident Manoj, son of Kumbhavade village Sarpanch Pandharinath Mayekar was injured and hospitalised for two weeks in a Kolhapur hospital. When Amberkar was being searched, the police found a pen drive with several articles written by Warishe. They also found a phone recording in which Amberkar explicitly states in Marathi that he will finish off Warishe for publishing a news article against him. The accused had threatened Warishe earlier too for writing against him and the proposed petrochemicals refinery in Barsu-Solgaon. Just two hours before allegedly mowing down Warishe, Amberkar was heard telling a witness on the phone: \u201cEkacha kaam tamaam karayacha aahe (I have to finish off someone). Aaj karnar tyacha\u2026 Aaj aamhi\u2026 (I will do it today).\u201d This call recording was found in Amberkar\u2019s phone after a mirror image of the phone was taken, said police, and it corroborated his intention to harm the victim. Warishe worked as the editor and correspondent ofDainik Mahanagari Times, a Marathi daily, in Ratnagiri, and regularly wrote \u201chow the planned refinery project in Rajapur taluka (RRPCL) would harm the farmers\u201d. On February 6, 2023, when Amberkar allegedly ran him over, Warishe had published a report highlighting the \u201ccriminal\u201d acts of Amberkar and pictures of banners showing him with senior politicians. \u201cSince Warishe was giving news against him, Amberkar had threatened him several times,\u201d the police said in the chargesheet. Responding to queries on the status of the RRPCL\u2019s land acquisition plan, Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation, the nodal investment promotion agency under the state government, said, \u201cRRPCL has conducted the techno-feasibility survey from August 2022-May 2023. This survey was facilitated by MIDC and District Administration, Ratnagiri, wherein 46 written consents were obtained from concerned landowners. However, MIDC has not received the report from RRPCL, till date. RRPCL has not yet submitted a formal proposal for the land acquisition.\u201d At a tiny house in the remote Kasheli village in Rajapur, Shevanti Warishe, mother of Shashikant, said, \u201cWe want justice for my son. His killer should not get out of the jail at any cost. He should be punished severely. My son lost his life because of him. He should also face the same fate.\u201d The state government deposited Rs 25 lakh in the joint account of Shevanti and Shashikant Warishe\u2019s son Yash, as a fixed deposit, on which they receive an interest of Rs 14,000 a month. Having lost her son, Shevanti said, \u201cMy son died because of this refinery. We do not want this refinery here. My son should get justice.\u201d She added: \u201cHe would leave house in the morning and would come home at night. He was only dedicated to his work. I would worry about him and tell him to come home as soon as possible at night. But he would always assure me I do not need to worry and he will be fine. He would say he is working for the good of people and no one will harm him.\u201d Former bowling coach Bharat Arun recalls Ravi Shastri's encouragement for Kuldeep Yadav to enhance his fitness and become a top-notch Test bowler.

{"source": "Indian Express", "headline": "The big all India exam leak: Over 5 years, 1.4 crore job seekers in 15 states bore the brunt", "content": "The Bill to prevent paper leaks,introduced in Lok Sabha on Monday, says it will serve as a \u201cmodel draft for States to adopt at their discretion.\u201d This couldn\u2019t be more timely. For, it is in states that the problem of exam leaks is most acute \u2013 and widespread. The Indian Expressinvestigated 41 documented instances of leaks over the last five years in recruitment exams across 15 states \u2014 their governments cutting across party lines. What emerged was startling: The leaks derailed schedules of as many as 1.4 crore applicants, applying for a little over 1.04 lakh posts. So sweeping is the distress \u2013 among candidates, their families, and successive batches of candidates \u2014 that exam leak and disruption was a hot talking point in the most recent state poll campaigns. More so as it is linked to job vacancies at a time when the government employment pie is shrinking across states. In Rajasthan, theBJPtrained its guns against the then ruling Congress, alleging the involvement of senior party functionaries in paper leaks. In Telangana, the Congress attacked the BRS government over leaks in TSPS-conducted examinations. Both defeated the incumbent. The issue even figured in the Prime Minister\u2019s poll speeches who, speaking in the coaching hub of Kota last November, alleged that the Congress had \u201csold papers for all exams\u201d and guaranteed that all those involved in paper leaks will be put behind bars. The investigation by the newspaper\u2019s team of state correspondents covered a range of recruitment exams \u2013 from teacher eligibility tests in Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh to police recruitment examinations in Assam, Rajasthan, Karnataka, andJammu& Kashmir; from a forester recruitment examination in Uttarakhand to engineer recruitment exams in Telangana, Arunachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir and Rajasthan.  Each leak was distinctive: in Assam, the question paper was circulated on WhatsApp minutes after the exam started; in Rajasthan, a state employee allegedly stole the paper from a government office; in Madhya Pradesh, police claimed the accused managed to \u201chack into servers\u201d of a private company inMumbaitasked with conducting the examinations; and in Maharashtra, a student approached the police reporting a leak on social media. Whatever the nature of the leak, its cascading effects have taken many a toll. After the cancellation, the long wait #In most cases, the wait for re-examination is long. Take, for instance, the Group-1 prelim examination conducted by the Telangana State Public Services Commission. It was held on October 16, 2022 but cancelled in March 2023 after a Special Investigation Team probing allegations of paper leak found credible leads supporting the allegations. The re-examination conducted on June 11, 2023 was also cancelled after some candidates approached the Telangana High Court alleging irregularities. More than 3.8 lakh candidates were competing for 503 posts to various departments through this screening exam, the first step of the selection process. The wait continues. #In at least 15 cases, exams were held almost a year after the leak; in four cases, the wait for two years; and in seven cases, the candidates still wait. #In Gujarat, almost 6 lakh candidates appeared in a recruitment exam for close to 4,000 posts of clerks and office assistants in November 2019. After the exam was cancelled, the wait lasted more than two years \u2014 the re-examination was conducted in April 2022 by the Gujarat Subordinate Staff Selection Board. #Some cases, though, are outliers. On September 9, 2020, minutes after a recruitment examination to 597 unarmed police sub-inspector posts began, the Assam State Level Police Recruitment Board cancelled it following reports that the question paper had been leaked on WhatsApp. More than 66,000 candidates had appeared. The BJP state government rushed to organise the re-examination and conducted it two months later on November 22. The state arrested 40 including a senior police officer and 36 were named in the chargesheet. Absence of accountability Assam\u2019s action was the exception rather than rule. In most cases, months and years have gone by without action. #No arrests have been made yet in three cancelled exams conducted by the Telangana State Public Services Commission in January and February 2023 for accounts officers and assistant executive engineers, which affected 2.5 lakh candidates. Moreover, the re-examinations were put off because of the Telangana legislative assembly elections in December 2023 and are yet to be re-held. #In Haryana, a recruitment examination by the state Public Service Commission to 383 veterinary surgeons on January 15 last year was cancelled on the basis of \u201csuspicion\u201d of a paper leak, but noFIRwas registered and the re-examination has not yet been held. #Scandal after scandal has prompted various state governments to introduce their own legislation against examination malpractices. Following the outcry when the paper for the Rajasthan Eligibility Exam for Teachers leaked in 2021 \u2013 affecting 12.67 lakh candidates and for which more than 100 people were arrested \u2013 the state government passed a law with provisions of punishment for up to 10 years of imprisonment and fines of up to Rs 10 crore, as well as of attachment and confiscation of property, for paper leaks. Despite this, more paper leaks have followed, after which the state government amended the law to increase the maximum punishment to life imprisonment. #Multiple states issued such laws and ordinances in 2023. Jharkhand, Uttarakhand and Gujarat all introduced anti-cheating laws, which have provisions for imprisonment of both examinees and service providers found using unfair means. The laws introduced by all three states also have provisions for disbarring examinees found guilty from writing future recruitment exams for a specified period of time. #The Assam state government introduced a similar ordinance in October 2023 and introduced a bill to this end in the assembly session on Monday. The promises and assurances Many states say they are moving to introduce anti-cheating legislation. #In Madhya Pradesh, following this year\u2019s Pariksha pe Charcha, School Education Minister Rao Uday Singh spoke about bringing in stricter laws to prevent exam leaks. \u201cWe are also discussing ways to ensure there are stringent provisions for bail for those accused in paper leaks for all kinds of examinations\u2026 We are also mulling introducing stricter rules governing third parties which conduct examinations to ensure there are no leaks\u2026 During elections, there were protests by students acrossBhopaland Indore (during the patwari paper leaks), and the government took swift action \u2013 the examination was paused and an investigation ordered. It is top priority for us,\u201d said a senior official of the education department. #While the Bharat Rashtra Samiti government in Telangana had appointed a Special Investigation Team to probe the causes and persons involved in leaks during its tenure, it did not specifically ask for a plan to stop them. The SIT is yet to submit its report. However, TSPSC officials have decided that moving forward, exam administrators will not store question papers in computers inside rooms where others are also working. The new Congress Government in Telangana is also mulling moving the pen and paper exam online. Newly appointed TSPSC director, former DGP M Mahender Reddy, has said that his first task is to formulate a plan to prevent leaks. #Following the new BJP government coming into power in Rajasthan, in his first press conference, Chief MinisterBhajan Lal Sharmaannounced setting up of a Special Investigation Team to check paper leaks in the state. A month and half later, School Education Minister Madan Dilawar told The Indian Express, \u201cAs per the CM\u2019s instructions, the SIT is investigating the paper leaks. And the facts which will come during the investigation will help in addressing the leaks.\u201d He said that only when the investigation is complete will the government be in a position to figure out the gaps and plug them. #Arunachal Pradesh, too, witnessed public outrage over the function of the state public service commission following the 2022 leak in assistant engineer recruitment exam. The state government then constituted a one-man inquiry commission with a mandate to \u201cinvestigate alleged question paper leaks\u201d in various recruitment exams conducted by the APPSC during an eight-year period from April 2014 to August 2022. #The Karnataka government had constituted a one-man inquiry commission headed by Justice B Veerappa following irregularities in the police sub-inspector recruitment examination in 2021. In the last week of January, Justice Veerappa submitted a 471-page report to the Chief Minister, which includes 28 witnesses and 325 documents highlighting irregularities in the recruitment process. He said the report also highlights areas where loopholes can be filled.

According to officials, through the relaunched scheme, the Karnataka Health Department will provide free sanitary napkins to around 19 lakh girls (aged 10 to 18 years) in government and aided schools and colleges across the state. The health department will directly deliver sanitary pads to the schools which will be distributed to the girls by the heads. Each kit would have 10 sanitary napkins in a pack. Napkins required for one year will be given to the girl students. Health Minister Dinesh Gundu Rao said this scheme is important for the hygiene and health of girl students. Earlier, the project was started by the previous Siddaramaiah-led state government. However, Rao said, he doesn't know why such an important project was stopped by the later (BJP-led) government. \"In our Congress government, after I became the Health Minister, I had announced that the scheme would be revived,\" he said. While the Congress government has implemented Shakti and Gruha Lakshmi Scheme in favour of women, the Shuchi Yojana, which was started with a collective vision for girls' health, cannot be ignored, he said. \u201cWe are providing free sanitary napkins to 19 lakh school and college girls at a cost of 47 crores. Girls from very poor families cannot not afford it,\u201d he said. The Minister also emphasised that menstruation is a natural process and that there is no need for girls to be hesitant about this. There are some superstitions attached to it and it is important to get rid of them and create awareness about cleanliness and the use of sanitary napkins, he said. Cleanliness and scientific management of menstruation are important for girls' health, he added. \u201cAs an alternative to sanitary pads, we have implemented a pilot program in two districts to distribute menstrual cups under Shuchi Yojana. Menstrual cups are eco-friendly and the project has received a good response,\u201d Rao said. The Health Minister also said that the health department will take up a program to create more awareness about the use of menstrual cups instead of sanitary pads.

Union Minister for Finance Nirmala Sitharaman is in Bengaluru for Express Adda and is currently interacting with Anant Goenka, Executive Director, The Indian Express Group, and P Vaidyanathan Iyer, Executive Editor, The Indian Express. 'If each of the southern states put their arguments well and convincingly, with data in their hands, more to promote their own strengths and highlight their challenges the face, the finance commission will come up with a formulation,' Sitharaman said. The event is being held at a time when the Central government is charting out India\u2019s growth trajectory with a focused thrust on capital expenditure. It is also a time when the global risks from geopolitical conflicts run the risk of affecting trade, commodity prices and supply chains. The challenge for the Finance Minister then is to maintain the growth path amid the continuing risks from such factors. Catch up with what else Nirmala Sitharaman says at Express Adda Raising the issue of drinking water and Cauvery issue, Aam Aadmi Party leaders slammed Deputy Chief Minister D K Shivakumar in a press conference on Wednesday. \"The tanker mafia is being run by corporators, former corporators, relatives of MLAs and MLAs. The government has completely failed to solve the drinking water problem. All this is happening right under the nose of Deputy CM DK Shivakumar, but it is not visible,\" Aam Aadmi Party state organising secretary Mohan Dasari said. Dasari added that doubts were raised about Shivakumar's role in the mafia. Dasari further said the BWSSB has not done anything as an alternative for Cauvery water. \"According to the Right to Information Act, the BWSSB has laid only 108 borewells in entire Bengaluru city. This means that BWSSB has not done anything to supply water to Bengaluru completely. Cauvery water is not reaching all houses in Bengaluru. The BBMP has also drilled 1,534 borewells and both these agencies have completely failed to provide water to all households. They are actively working in the unauthorized tanker mafia. The supply of tanker water is unauthorised and is not permitted in law. However, the water supply mafia is rampant in Bengaluru, he said. The price of tanker water, which was supposed to be Rs 600 before the onset of summer, has reached Rs 3,000,\" he said. \"DK Shivakumar knows how important drinking water is for Namma Bengaluru. If you have drinking water, then only you can make a Brand Bengaluru. The government should curb the tanker mafia, they should be taxed. Even if you can't give water free of cost, make arrangements to provide water at a lower price. Otherwise, people will come to your house and ask you to give me water,\" he said. \"Make a mobile app yourself and allow consumers to book tankers. Give the helpline number and respond to people's problems. Otherwise, it will not be surprising if there is a big fight for water in the coming days,\" he said. Bengaluru City President Dr. Satish said that in a meeting chaired by BWSSB officials and the chief secretary of urban development, Rs 131 crore was given to 110 villages for drilling borewells. \"Only 257 places in Bengaluru are facing water scarcity. This is a big joke and day light lie. He said there was a water crisis in 50 places in one assembly constituency.  Karnataka Legislative Assembly witnessed a stormy session on Wednesday as opposition BJP staged a protest from the well of the House, urging the Congress government to resign over its \u201cinaction\u201d in\u2018Pakistan zindabad\u2019 slogan row. The saffron party alleged that supporters of Congress leader Syed Naseer Hussain raised \u201cPakistan zindabad\u201d slogan following Hussain\u2019s victory in Rajya Sabha polls. Hussain\u2019s supporters also rocked the House proceedings, forcing repeated disruptions, PTI reported. Meanwhile, Chief Minister\u00a0Siddaramaiah\u00a0said \u201cstrict action will be taken\u201d if the allegations were proven true. Siddaramaiah\u2019s statement came hours after the Bengaluru city police registered a suo motu case on Tuesday night over the alleged incident even as the\u00a0BJP\u00a0filed a formal complaint at the Vidhana Soudha police station. Siddaramaiah said that if the FSL report proved that such a slogan was raised, action would be taken. \u201cThere is no question of protecting those who raised slogans in favour of Pakistan,\u201d Siddaramaiah said while speaking to the media at Vidhana Soudha on Wednesday. \u201cStrict action will be taken against whoever shouted slogans against the nation,\u201d he added. Hussain also denied the BJP\u2019s allegations and said some of his followers had raised \u201cNasir Saab Zindabad\u201d slogans. \u201cI was heading home and received a call from a media house that someone raised such a slogan. I was in the middle of those people and never heard any such slogan. Let the police investigate the matter,\u201d he said. To enhance last-mile connectivity to Bengaluru's Namma Metro stations, a fleet of women operated electric auto rickshaws were introduced at Indiranagar and Yelachenahalli metro stations on Wednesday. The Low Emission Access to Public transport (LEAP), an initiative of Alstom, a multinational company that offers solutions for a low carbon future, is done in collaboration with WRI India, a research organisation that aims to influence government policies and civil society actions. The other collaborators are Bengaluru Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) and Metroride, an app dedicated to first and last mile connectivity. \u201cAs part of the pilot phase of the programme, we will have electric autos deployed as a last-mile service at Yelachenahalli and Indiranagar stations, serving commuters in a radius of 4 km from each station,\u201d Olivier Loison, managing director of Alstom India, told PTI. The pilot initiative was launched by former MP Rajeev Gowda, vice chairman of State Institute for the Transformation of Karnataka and member of Brand Bengaluru Committee. Kalpana Kataria, executive director of BMRCL was also present. Loison said Indiranagar was chosen as a pilot project because it's a commercial hub close to the city centre and therefore, witnesses heavy traffic movement. \u201cAlthough a residential area primarily, Yelachenahalli too is rapidly transforming into a major IT hub,\u201d he said. According to him, sustainable transport options in these two stations can significantly benefit metro commuters by bridging last mile connectivity issues. The reason why women drivers were specifically brought under the programme is to ensure gender inclusivity, said Loison. \u201cWomen will feel safer with women drivers of the e-autos,\u201d he added. As for Saraswati, a 40-year-old widow, who took to driving an auto after the death of her husband three years ago, being engaged by Metroride has been a life saver. While she said she did not have to invest upfront in buying an autorickshaw, another advantage is that she gets to choose her working hours. \u201cI have opted for morning shifts, I finish by 4pm so that I can go home before my daughters return from college. I am paid Rs 800 every day, even if I don't manage to get many rides,\u201d said Saraswati, who has opted to drive an auto at the Yelachenahalli metro station, close to her home. Learning from this project will serve as a blueprint for scaling similar solutions, said Loison. \u201cIt's a collective challenge. We and our partners are working for the convenience of the people of Bengaluru,\u201d he added. PTI Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on Wednesday said serious action would be taken if it's found true that a pro-Pakistan slogan was raised after the Rajya Sabha election results were declared. \"It is not only an allegation by the BJP, it is also an allegation by the media,\" he said, referring to the charge that \"Pakistan zindabad\" slogan was heard after one of the Congress candidates, Syed Naseer Hussain, was declared the winner at \"Vidhana Soudha\" on Tuesday. \"We have sent the voice report to the FSL (Forensic Science Laboratory). When the report comes, if it's true that somebody has made a slogan that 'Pakistan zindabad', such person will be punished seriously,\" the chief minister said. If somebody has raised such a slogan, there is no question of sparing them. \"If it is true, we will take strict action, serious action,\" he said.(PTI) Karnataka temple Bill controversy: The Karnataka government\u2019s attempt to tweak the law that governs taxation ofHindu temples was stymied in the Legislative Council, where the primary Opposition, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), holds a majority.
